            <h1>Week 5 <small>(September 15, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Welcome to the Jungle</h3>
            <p><small>Dearest family,<br>
    Happy Cochabamba Independence Day! Actually, it was yesterday, but
since the Bolivian people need a holiday (there are holidays like
every 2 weeks), people are celebrating today and not working. They
really try to find any excuse to get a day of work off. Cochabamba is
204ish years old now. Is there a Salt Lake City Independence Day?
Maybe it is just the same as the Utah one. Anyways, this was an
interesting week. Some highs and some lows. We just got back from the
Jungle (hence, the title), but I will explain that later. This is what
happened this week...<br><br>

Tuesday- Nothing really special. We had district meeting and that was
pretty normal. We had to go to the airport (like we do all the time)
and send some missionaries back to Tupiza. In our zone meeting we
found out that we were going to have to do the special musical number
for Thursday´s zone conference, so the Zone Leaders went around asking
which of us sang. I didnt really want to, but I figured I can kinda
sing, so I volunteered. We had to stay after for a little bit to
practice. After that we went to the office to have my little zone
leader meetings. There are 9 zones in Cochabamba, and all the zone
leaders inside Cocha just come in and talk with me. I just make sure
that they are using their money well and not losing anything. A
generally boring concept, but I like all the zone leaders, so it is a
good time usually. We always have to stay in the office until like 8
to finish everything.<br><br>

Wednesday- The big day. We went to the airport in the morning to send
the Hansens, the APs, and Elder Waddell. We got there first, but soon
after the Hansens and Elder Waddell got there. We were just sitting
around talking with them for a little bit getting to know Elder
Waddell. He is huge, like 6´7". He is super cool too. He cracks jokes
and is just really nice. He was just asking us where we were from and
stuff like that and then asked what our positions were. I told him
financial secretary and he just smiled and said "Ya know, that´s the
only position in the mission where you can get excommunicated". He
said it like it was just some fun fact, but if I ever get tempted to
do bad things here, I will have the words of a 70 warning me. I was
kinda of expecting him to be a little bit more serious and straight
forward, but he is just super cool and relaxed. When Elder Weekes told
him he was from Provo, Elder Waddell said "I hear there´s a few
members in Provo, right?". Just super dry humor, which is my favorite.
After we sent them off, the day was pretty normal. Just regular office
work and stuff.<br><br>

Thursday- We had the zone conference with Elder Waddell. It was
soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. He spoke to us for a
good 5-6 hours. He spoke about a bunch of good things. I just felt
like everything was directed at me. I took a good 6 pages of notes. He
spoke about how we are called to SERVE God, that is the purpose of a
mission. Also, we will receive experiences here that are designed for
us. That´s why some people are APs, Zone Leaders, Secretaries, or just
regular missionaries. Not because it makes us better, but because we
personally need those experiences. We learned that Elder Andersen
wasnt Zone Leader or Assistant on his mission, but he was called to be
an apostle in his 50s. He also spoke about baptizing converts, not
just numbers. Just how we as missionaries can fall into the bad habit
of caring how many baptisms we have, but the only thing that matters
is if we baptize converts, people that will help the church grow and
be great members. Other great things like Reverance bring Revelation,
prayer is what will convert people, and the most important thing is
that this is God´s work, not ours. I really couldve listen to him for
a long time. We had the special musical number as well, like I said
before. Me, Christensen, Prado, another elder, and 3 hermanas sang
Nearer My God to Thee (part english and part spanish). It actually
turned out really well. President Hansen mentioned it in his talk, and
then told me and Elder Christensen in person that it was great. At
night, there was a big meeting with Elder Waddell, Pres Hansen, and
Pres Jensen where they spoke with all the leadership of the 5 stakes
of Cochabamba. It was really good, and the area presidency is really
focused on the work of salvation. Hopefully this will help the
missionaries and members to work better.<br><br>

Friday- Just a regular day. Nothing I can really remember.<br><br>

Saturday- In the morning we woke up and found out we didnt have water.
We called around trying to talk to the water company and stuff. That
took up our whole morning. We couldve just left, but there is a family
that lives behind us so we kinda felt responsible to getting them
water too. In the afternoon we had great plans but... we had to go to
the office so Elder Christensen could do something. That took away
most of our day. I really dont like going to the office on Saturday,
but it is necessary sometimes. We had a lesson with a recent convert,
but that was it.<br><br>

Sunday- Part of our ward is good, part is annoying. The bishopric are
kind of boring people, but they are nice and are starting to get it
together with the whole mission work thing in the ward. There are some
leaders that are just make everything hard. They just complain about
everything in ward counsel and stuff. Really bugs me. We will try to
get things going though. EVERYTHING fell through in the afternoon, so
we were just left with some less actives, and those lessons didnt go
great. It was a bad day, but we keep going. One of these days we´ll
get something going here.<br><br>

Monday- We went to the jungle! Well, kinda. It is the sub-tropic, but
it still looked like the jungle to me. It is called Incachaca (Inca
bridge in quechua). There is a suspension bridge, cool waterfalls, and
it is so green. It is cool how in one week we can go to the mountains
and play in the snow, and a few weeks later we can go to the jungle.
Those are the benefits of my mission. We had a 2 hour car ride to get
there, but we just went with 8 elders in our van, so it was fun. I
have a lot of pictures to put up from today.<br><br>

Even though we had little success in the area this week, just being
able to listen to Elder Waddell made this a great week. I am 100% he
is inspired by God, because he literally said everything that I needed
to hear. This is transfers week, but I am sure I am staying. We´ll
know a month before I am going anyways. Christensen might be leaving,
but we´ll see. I love you guys so much, and I´ll talk to you next
week.<br>
Love,<br>
   Elder Bagley

                        <p>Back to real life. We had to go to the airport for the billionth time. We sent E Villa and E Barahona back to Sucre. After that we went back to the office. I was going to study, but I got to the office and I got swamped with work. We went to the district meeting after that. We learned about love and charity. After that we had a little exercise where we had to answer questinos about our companions. I had to stay after because we are going to do a special musical number on Thursday for zone conference. After lunch I just went to the office and met with the zone leaders. I ran out of envelopes, probably the exciting part of my day (sad life). Nighttime was pretty normal, nothing special really. I had to talk to Elder Weekes because I'm pretty sure they lost 400bs. It's kind of annoying because he doesn't really see the problem or think it matters. He's kind of frustrating to work with sometimes. My stomach was hurting really bad at dinner, but all is good now. Tomorrow is the big day where we meet Elder Waddell.</p>

                        <p>The big day. Today I had the opportunity of meeting Elder W Christopher Waddell of the 1st quorum of the 70. We went to the airport to send him, the Hansens, and the APs to Sucre. We met him at the airport. He is huge, like 6'7". He's super nice though, and funny. He talked to us for a little bit and then asked what our positions in the mission were. I said Financial Secretary and he just smiled and said "Ya know, that's the only position in the church where you can get excommunicated". It was fun fact of the day I guess. It was memorable to have a 70 tell me that. He went on to tell us both how important our jobs are and that we have them because the Lord trusts us. Even in just plain talking, he is uplifting. After that is was just a boring day. Went to the bank and all that. Not too exciting, but hopefully tomorrow will be. We will get to listen to Elder Waddell basically all day. This is the first authority to visit our mission in about a year, and the first GA I'll listen too since the MTC. I'm really excited, and I'm sure it'll be great.</p>

                      <h3>September 11, 2014</h3>
                      <p>Today was great. The morning was just normal, studying and what not. At around 10:30 we got to the Universidad stake center. We set up tables for lunch, and practiced a musical number. Then we started. We had a special zone conference with Elder W Christopher Waddell of the 70. It was amazing. One of the best conferences I've been to. Elder Waddell is a great teacher. We learned about a lot of things. Things that stuck out to me was that we are baptizing <u>converts</u> into the church, not just baptized for numbers. We also need to apply the doctrine we learn, and help the investigators to do the same. I took a lot of notes in my study journal. Me, along with 6 others from the zone sang the special musical number, which Pres Hansen commeted on twice. Overall, a great conference. We hurried and went to dinner and then to the office to staple hundreds of copies of these papers for a nightime meeting. We had another meeting, this time for all ward counsel members in Cocha. Elder Waddell again spoke, this time about the "Work of Salvation" and members working with missionaries. Another great conference. Today I could learn for sure that Elder Waddell is called by God. Just a geat day overall.</p>

                    <p>After a busy day yesterday, today was pretty normal, boring even. We studied and stuff in the morning. When I got to the office, really the only thing I did was write on some envelopes. We let E' Calderon be 100% in charge of the food for the other zone conference, and he did surprisingly well. The afternoon was just like the morning. Just paying bills and stuff. We paid the water bill, but while waiting in line I got cut in front of 2 times by 2 old people. We hung out with E Weekes and E Saad for a little bit in the office as well. At night we had a lesson with Genoveva (recent convert) and her daughter Teresa. Really solid lesson. They are solid converts and act like they should. Teresa mentioned how the ward lacks energy, which is so true. I came home and put on a prophet movie, but I started falling asleep. That always happens. Oh well, we have decent plans for tomorrow, so hopefully it's a good day.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <p>Well today sucked. We woke up and found out we didn't have water. I paid it yesterday after the company shut it off, but it took forever. We ended up calling a water truck to fill the tank. We got to lunch late because we had to go pay for people to get out of the hospital. Lunch was with Hna Urquidi, who teaches the gospel principles class. It was good, and she told us a lot about some historical CBBA things. We had to go to the office after for Christensen. The office on saturday always sucks. Interesting/weird moment of the day. We'd heard rumors of the secretary from next door getting "together" with her boss, but today I heard evidence. Sounds that I didn't need to hear. Yikes. We tried to go work, but everything fell through or people just really didn't want to talk to us. We had our ward mission meeting, but it was really pointless. There was this hermana there making it difficult. She even suggested making an investigator a ward missionary. Not exactly the best day ever. I'll take it as a learning opportunity and hopefully things will get better.</p>

                    <p>Woohoo! Happy Cochabamba day! It's like the 204th anniversary of Cochabamba. It's a lot bigger deal than it would be in Utah. I have no idea when Salt Lake City day is. Church was just normal today. I sit by myself, but I really need to just go sit with anybody I can, sitting by myself looks weird. I met with some of the Hermana's investigators. I figure if I don't have anyone to show around of my own, I can just help all the Hermanas' investigators. Elder's quorum wasn't as (heated), but I fell asleep/ The EQ pres wore sunglasses all day. He's weird. We had lunch with this lady from next door. Kinda weird, but really nice. We tried to contact some references in the afternoon, but it didn't work. We had a lesson with Santiago Torres, but he is tough. He just doesn't have much faith in us, Christ, or himself. It makes it tough. We also taught Hna Escobar. She's not 100% there mentally, so lessons don't do much. Me and Christensen talked a lot about how we need to get better. Just to work harder. The rest of the night was normal, just playing around with Catlaya (not sure how to spell it). All is well though, tomorrow we're going to Incachaca.</p>

                        <p>Today was a great p-day. We woke up early so we could go to Incachaca. It was like a 2 hour drive, so we left at 6ish so we could have time to do things there. My bus ws super cool. I was with Severiano, Christensen, Laidlaw, Valerio, Cardona, Skousen, and Stoker. We just told funny stories on the way there (the best one involved Valerio knocking out a drunk girl with a shoe). Incachaca was super cool. It is sub-tropical, so it's super green and basically jungleish. We hiked around and saw cool waterfalls, a suspension bridge, and an old mill where they first generated electricity here. We took a bunch of pictures and stuff. At one point Hna Rumualdo full out slapped me, not sure why. It's really the first time I've been to an area like this, so I liked it a lot. The only thing I didn't like was it was so humid, so hiking uphill in the sun was terrible. On the bus ride home, we all just fell asleep. Afterwards we just went to the office to do email. Everything is pretty normal at home. I also just talked to Weekes and Saad. Sounds like Christensen might leave after all, we'll just have to wait and see. My night was complicated because I found out an Elder is missing money because he withdrew money 13 times, meaning we unnecessarily love 350bs. I wasn't too happy, but such is life.</p>
