            <h1>Week 6 <small>(September 22, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>It´s a Hardknock Life</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
   What a week... We worked as much in the mission field as you guys,
so 0 minutes. We had to do office stuff all week. Elder Christensen
had to do everything for the missionaries leaving, missionaries
coming, and the transfers, and I had to finish the Hansen´s finances
for the month. We were at the office or doing other stuff outside all
week. Plus, we had a bunch of other fun things, such as having our
water pump break and I had to give a talk and for some reason in every
meeting Elder Christensen was asked to play the piano, so we had extra
meetings. I´ll try to explain the week the best I can, but it´s not
super exciting.<br><br>

Tuesday- We just had a regular zone meeting and district meeting. We
had to go to the post office in the morning so that I could send some
money to some zone leaders.Then just hanging out with the zone leaders
and all that fun stuff. Nothing too exciting.<br><br>

Wednesday- Not a very exciting day either. We went to the airport...I
have the airport memorized at this point. The cool part is that there
is this lady that works for the church that helps us at the airport.
She is super cool, but not a member. She jokes around with us and
stuff. She´ll get baptized one day. At night we were working hard so
that we could go out and work. We got everything done, left and office
and... President Hansen called and told us to go up to the mission
home. So close. So what was going on is that there is an Hermana in
the mission that has some pretty serious health problems that they
just found. President asked us to go help him give her a blessing.
It´s pretty cool to hear President Hansen give a blessing. After that
we got to eat milk and cookies with Hermana Hansen which was fun.<br><br>

Thursday- Another ehh day. Only thing was that there was a missionary
going home, so we went to the airport.<br><br>

Friday- We went totally old school on Friday. So like I said before,
our water pump broke. We actually had known that it was broken for
some time, but now it just doesnt work. We worked with Hno Nacho to
see what was wrong, and then we had to call the house owner to
explain. We have water, but it doesnt go through the pipes. This led
to us doing some old school things, such as flushing the toilet with a
bucket of water, washing the dishes with a bucket of water, and my
personal favorite, showering using a bucket (with freezing cold
water). One day, I hope to have just a regular life when it comes to
water. At night me and Christensen tried to clean up the yard because
the owner was coming. I still have to pull weeds on the mission, it´s
terrible. Our lawn just randomly sprouted a nice rose bush, that only
happens in Bolivia.<br><br>

Saturday- Throughout the morning we were helping the owner fix the
pump, or at least find out the problem. I found it relatively funny
that we had 2 brother (our owner and his brother) who had moustaches
and they were doing plumbing work. It was like Mario and Luigi. After
all that we had to go to lunch with the Flia Vallejos. They are super
cool, one of the few families in the ward that are really personable.
After that we went up to the mission home to see the cambios. We even
helped a little bit, nothing major, but just a few here or there.
Logistical things mostly. That´s one perk of being secretary is that
we get to know things early. That night we went to a baptism. There
were like 4 baptisms in the stake. We gave our musical number again as
well. Only 3 people got baptized at first, then the other one got
baptized later. We had a whole big fiasco where we thought the one guy
wasnt going to get baptized and random weird accusations were going
around and stuff. Crazy night.<br><br>

Sunday- I had to give a talk on one day´s notice. Just regular
missionary stuff. I spoke on the Book of Mormon. It actually turned
out pretty well, I was surprised. I also confirmed someone, which is a
really cool experience. We had to go to the office in the afternoon to
finish President´s finances for the month. There was a Fireside in our
stake with President Hansen. Christensen played piano, and I led the
music, just like dad used to do. After that we made pizza at the
pensionista´s house. We also got the official cambios. Our zone isnt
going to be as fun anymore. Other things are that Elder Prado is
leaving the offices in a week, and Elder Christensen is going to start
training his replacement in a few weeks and then leave in November. I
finally am going to see some of my friends that have been outside of
Cocha for a while. People I havent seen in 14 months.<br><br>

Monday- We played basketball in the morning. It was really fun, we had
a really good group. There´s a nice wood court in the middle of Cocha
that we had never heard about before. We also had to go help at a
special seminar for the missionaries that are going home tomorrow.
Later today we are going to have a white elephant with the zone.<br><br>

So as you can see, not a really exciting week. On Saturday, everything
was off schedule, we didnt have water, I had to give a talk, and we
had to go to the baptism. I almost got stressed, but everything worked
out. This week we get to pick up all the new missionaries and stuff,
which is always fun. It´s weird that this new group has the same time
as Griffin. I love you all, and I will talk to you next week. Oh ya, I
hit 15 months this week. Love you<br>
Elder Bagley

                        <p>I'm really tired for some reason. It's probably cause of the long drive yesterday. Today was pretty normal. In the morning, we just studied like normal. At around 9:30 we went out to run so errands at the correo and at the store. Then we had the district meeting. We just talked about the conference with Elder Waddell and what we learned. The zone meeting was good too. Elder Alexander bore his final testimony because he leaves next week. Elder Laidlaw and Severiano also said some stuff, and they're just great. You could really feel the spirit. The office was just normal. The office was jsut normal. Best part was watching a video we took yesterday. Me and Elder Skousen made a little jungle exploration video in a british accent. We watched it with him, Jerry, Laidlaw, Severiano, and Cardona and we just died laughing. Other than that, nothing cool to report. I really am so tired. I just fell asleep for a little bit while I writing. I don't really see this week as being very interesting, but you never know, stuff comes up.</p>

                        <p>Finally, a Wednesday that had something that wasn't boring. We woke up and... didn't have water. Semapa, the water company, was terrible customer service. They were supposed to put the water back on saturday, but they finally did it today after calling again. We had to go to the airport and pick up 2 Hnas (Webb and Prieto) and then send them to do tramites. After that we just went to the office and worked. At lunch me and Christensen had to eat at a separate table because there wasn't space, so we made it fun and set up chairs for stuffed animals to sit with us. After that we just worked in the office like normal. I had to call a missionary's parents, who happen to live in my high school boundaries, it was kinda weird. We were on our way to go work in the field, but pres Hansen called and had us go help him give a blessing to Hna Zavaleta who has health problems. It was a neat experience, and we got to eat milk and cookies after. I really like the Hansens. Anyways, a pretty good day actually. This week is going by fast.</p>

                      <p>Well, not my best day ever. Firstly, the water doesn't really work. It seems like the little machine that sends water up is broken, so we are left with basically just the water in the pipes. That makes things very inconvenient (don't know how to spell that). Other "fun" part of the day was at lunch. In a little recuerdo book that Hna Hansen has, Prado drew a big head on me. Now, I know I have a big head, it's pretty noticeable (not super bad though). Anyways, Prado was super proud of it and started showing it to everyone. Well, that bothered me a lot. Don't know why, but it did. When things bother me, I react poorly, so we left to avoid a bad reaction. I'm starting to get really tired of Prado and Calderon. The rest of my day just involved talking to the assistants a little bit and reimbursing some hermanas. Not the most exciting day, plus not having water, plus Prado bothering me makes for a less than happy Elder Bagley.</p>

                    <h3>September 19, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Woohoo, 15 months!!! It's not really a significant number, but it's still another month. Today wasn't super exciting. We just worked in the office. In the afternoon, we had to go to the airport because Elder Vanegas was going home. He's... different. His bags were overweight because he took home things like candy, powerade, Inca Cola, more candy, and monopoly. Didn't really make a lot of sense. It was fun, to hang out with Elder Prescott and Elder Adams though. After that we just went to the office. At night we had planned to eat out with the APs and the Hansens, but the Hansens ended up not going. We ended up just eating at Cine Center with everyone besides the Hansens. It was pretty fun. I talked with Weekes most of the time. He basically told me he's leaving this cambio, which sucks. I'll miss him. The rest of the night was spend trying to fix the water pump. We just never get to rest with the water. If we have water, the pump doesn't work. When we don't have water, the pump is fine. We ended up calling the owners so that he can come fix it. One day, we will just have regular water.</p>

                    <p>Today was a little more exciting I guess. We woke up and started cutting the grass, because we needed it to look good for the owner. Then he came to fix it. I found it funny that we had him and brother working on it. 2 guys, brothers, with moustaches doing plumbing work... After that we just went to the office. We ate lunch with the Flia Vallejos. They're a super nice family. Following lunch, we went up to the mission home. We had to get some receipts and see the cambios. There were a lot of cambios. Our zone just isn't going to be the same. Laidlaw's gone, along with the cool hermanas. I was kinda disappointed. It was a cool experience though, as we got to help with cambios, just some little logistical things. At night we went to the "white" night, with 4 baptisms. We sang our musical number again. When it came to the baptisms, only 3 people got baptized. One person, from Ingavi, was accused of being a woman, not a man. That led to some huge fiasco, and he wasn't baptized I guess. That's the weirdest thing I've seen at a baptism. This week has been busy, I'm ready to rest.</p>

                    <p>Wow, even on Sunday we had to work in the office. Before we went to the office we had church, the spiritual part of the day. Sacrament meeting was interesting for 2 reasons. 1st, I had to give a talk. I spoke on the Book of Mormon. It turned out just fine. After that I confirmed someone. I guess the guy that we thought didn't end up getting baptized, got baptized. After church we went to the office, and then to the Flia Cortez's house. They're a super fun family, and make good food. The only problem is that they make <u>a</u> <u>lot</u> of food. We usually have a really good time there. After that we went back to the office. I really hate going to the office on Sunday, but it was necessary. After finally finishing up there, we went to the chapel for a special fireside with Pres Hansen. It was a good fireside and stuff. Then at night we found out the cambios. From the zone, Laidlaw, Rumualdo, and Hansen are leaving. Rumualdo is going to Tupiza, which makes me really jealous. We made pizza at the pension though. We had to enjoy the pension one last time, as it won't be the same anymore.</p>

                        <p>Today was a solid p-day. In the morning we went to the big stake center to help set up a meeting the leaving missionaries had. It's about jobs and school and stuff. After that we went to this gym to play basketball. We had a pretty solid group, with me, Jerry, Grigor, Weekes, Watts, Porter, Thomson, and those guys. It was pretty fun. I'm out of shape though. After that we went to the stake again to help with lunch. It's fun being there with E Alexander, Phillips, and Sehestedt. Then we went to the office to do email. It's kinda weird cause Griffin is leaving for the field tomorrow. He's already got 6 weeks. It's going by fast. Me and Calderon left to go to the store. We had a white elephant as a zone. My gift was a signed picture of me, Elder Weekes, and Elder Saad. Also, a framed picture of myself. (Don't worry, it's just a joke gift, I'm not so self absorbed). It was a really fun activity, I'm gonna miss this zone a lot. I ended up with a Dora the Explorer doll. Hna Rumualdo got my gift, probably the funniest person that could've got it. The rest of the day was just spent in the office. Tomorrow is the start of cambio, so this is gonna be a busy, tiring week.</p>
