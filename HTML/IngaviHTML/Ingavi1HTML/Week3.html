            <h1>Week 3 <small>(September 1, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Airplanes: Part 2</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
   Well, it is already September. I´ve now finished 2 summers in my
mission, kinda a weird thing to think about. I dont really feel super
old in the mission, but I am. This means I started BYU like 2 years
ago, and it feels like it was yesterday. Weird... Anyways, this was a
week that wasnt too interesting, but I did learn a lot and we may have
found something really good. These are the things that happened this
week:<br><br>

Airplanes- I titled this email Airplanes, because I have been to the
airport probably 5 or 6 times in the last week. Airplanes part 2 is a
song, so that´s where that comes from. Usually we go to district
meeting on Tuesday, but we didnt this week. In the morning, we had to
go to the airport to send the Hansens and the Assistants to Sucre.
They were going on a mission tour, to every area outside of
Cochabamba. It was like a week long tour. In the airport, I told the
Hansens that the Carol Poulter had written and told me to tell them hi
for her. They told me that they should come be missionaries here, even
for like 6 months. That´d be super cool, and weird at the same time.
They´d be great though. After dropping all of them off, we went
hunting a missionary. Since Tupiza is a district, Pres Hansen has to
ordain the native missionaries from Tupiza. One got set apart last
week, and then was leaving on Tuesday. We were incharge of his flight
and travel stuff, so we went to send him to the airport. He was
staying at the temple hotel place, but had left to go say bye to
people. We had no way to contact him, and on top of that they moved
his flight and he didnt know. We just sat in the temple waiting for
him all morning. We got to talk to Pres Jay E Jensen, the temple
president, for a bit though, so that was cool. After waiting for like
an hour, Elder Silvera (this missionary) showed up and we hurried off
to the airport. He is going to Puerto Rico, which would be mindblowing
for someone from a small town like Tupiza. He is super cool though,
and will be a great missionary. I tried to give him all the advice I
could, which was the same kinda stuff I wrote to Griffin. We went to
the airport like 3 other times too during the week. Needless to say, I
am tired of the airport.<br><br>

Members- We are starting to see a bit of potential from the members.
At church yesterday, it just felt different. Especially during ward
counsel, everyone seemed more involved. We had lunch with the bishop
yesterday, and he isnt as scary as I thought. He is warming up to us.
We also got a random call from the 2nd counselor, asking us to come
over to his house. He needed help with his USA visa application, so we
helped. These things might seem small, but the support of the
bishopric is really really important (dad, make sure you help the
missionaries). I hope that the ward can get a little bit better. There
has been a good amount of success in Ingavi recently, but it could
explode if the members really get involved. We taught the Flia
Quiñonez, a less active family, again and it was good. We also ate
lunch with the Primary president on Saturday. We had chicken foot
soup, but luckily the chicken foot ended up in one of the hermana´s
bowls, so I escaped. Overall, the members of Ingavi are starting to
grow on me.<br><br>

Office- Nothing too special going on. Tomorrow my boss, Eddy Rocha, is
coming to make sure everything is going ok. I hear he has a difficult
personality, but I think he likes me so far. I figured that the boss
of the boss of the boss of the boss of the boss of my boss is the
presiding bishop. I am moving up in the world.<br><br>

Investigators- Nothing too special going on. The only investigators
that are going somewhat well are the Flia Castro. They are super nice
and love the missionaries. They are just a little hesistant to switch
churches, but we´ll work on it. Yesterday, the Hnas from Cobija gave
us a reference that seems really good. We have an appointment with him
on Thursday. He is SUPER interested and has been to church before. I
dont want to count my chickens before they hatch though (I am 100%
sure I learned that phrase from mom). Please send some prayers our way
so that this works out. We are trying really hard to find people, but
in the limited time we have it is hard.<br><br>

Study- I had some good studying this week. I learned a lot about
charity from 1 Cor 13. Also I read 1 Timothy 4, which is just great.
The scriptures are awesome, especially when you are actually looking
to learn something.<br><br>

P-Day- Today was a good p-day. At 9, me, Christensen, and 4 other
elders went out to Quillacollo (like 20-30 minutes away) to play
basketball on a wood court. There are only like 3 would courts in all
of Cocha. We played with a bishop from Quillacollo, his brother, and
his brother´s friend. It was super fun. I miss basketball. After that,
we went to the chapel to have a bbq with the zone. We also played
soccer and me and a few other guys played HORSE on the basketball
hoop. I was so tired afterwards. To finish off the day, we went and
got a haircut. This was the first place I´ve been that had the little
hairwashing stations where they wash your hair. That was the greatest
feeling ever, just having them wash my hair. I know it sounds weird,
but it is so true.<br><br>

I am glad you guys are all doing well. Sounds like Griffin is doing
well as well, even if he does have the Utah state chess champ as a
companion. I love you guys so much, and I will talk to you next
monday.<br><br>

Love,<br>
  Elder Duncan Bagley

                        <p>Today was a long day. We didn't just go to the airport once, but twice. First we went to take the Hansens and Weekes and Saad to send them off to Sucre. They're going on a trip around the entire mission, so they'll get to see Uyuni, Quiriza, and all the cool parts of the mission. After sending them off, we had to pass by the office. We we got there, Christensen found out that we had to take a Bolivian missionary from Tupiza to the airport to send him to his mission in Puerto Rico. The problem was we didn't really know where he was. Our best option was to go wait at the temple (where he was staying) and wait. We waited for like an hour (during that hour we talked to Elder Jay E Jensen like 3 times; which is cool/intimidating). Finally, the missionary, Elder Silvera, showed and we went back to the airport to send him off. He's a cool guy and he'll be a great missionary. We spent the whole morning doing that, so we didn't even go to zone meeting. That felt like a whole day's worth of work, but then I had to spend the new few hours in the office talking to zone leaders. I am pretty tired from today. It feels better to have a day like this though.</p>

                        <p>My big day of the month. Today I had to pay all of the missionaries in the mission. I'm in charge of distributing 400,000+bs or somewhere around $60,000. Quite a lot of money, especially for me. I rarely ever had more than $200 at home. Pres Dyer warned me about the bad things that can happen to members if they use the church's money in a way they shouldn't. I've realized how easy that'd be. I haven't had any problems though, so there's no need to worry. The day was regular besides that. We had 2 people show up to do tramites: Elder Jafek (met him for the first time, cool kid) and Elder Thurston (nice, but kinda annoying). They'll be here for a day or two. After spending most of the day in the office, we had an FHE with the Flia Quiñonez. The dad was sick, so he couldn't be there. We, along with the hermanas, taught about the atonement and forgiveness, using the Chris Williams mormon message. We also learned that "tanta" means old in Quechua, and "t'anta" means bread. The day was good enough, nothing really negative to say.</p>

                        <p>I don't really have anything interesting about today. I really just have like 2 things about today. Firstly, I had a good personal study today. I've been trying to improve my study recently. Today I learned a lot from 1 Tim 4. I was looking in that chapter to learn more about the apostasy, but I learned a lot of other cool stuff too. It talks about a lot of things that apply to missionary work. I really liked it. After study I was just in the office. I found out that my boss, Eddy Rocha, is coming on Tuesday, so I've got to get ready for that now. At night we went to try and teach the Flia Kawdingliana (the indian people) but they weren't there. So for the rest of the night we just took a letter to Nacho's house, and then we went to the pension. We are pretty sure that the pensionista, Hna Lazarte likes us the most. Just cause we're normal, but not too serious. I like going to the pension here. Boring day, tomorrow doesn't look promising either.</p>

                      <h3>August 29, 2014</h3>
                      <p>Well, I was right. Nothing really happened today either. I got another good personal study though. When I study interesting things that can apply to my life, it makes me realize how important the scriptures are. Today I learned about charity. In 1 Cor 13 it talks about charity a lot. The interesting part for me was that it says that charity is more important than faith and hope. If we don't have charity, nothing else matters. So I need more charity. I just cleaned my office today. I need it to look good for when my boss comes. I finished pretty early with everything, but we didn't leave until 7. Me, Christensen, and Jafek went to go teach less actives, but nobody was home. We ended up talking about high school sports between the 3 of us. Jafek is a cool kid, really good missionary too. Today was another slow day, but tomorrow is Saturday and that will hopefully be a little bit more exciting.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <h3>August 30, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Today was a fun/long day. I think it was fun just cause we had things to do. In the morning we went to the airport like always. We had to send Thurston and Jafek back to Sucre. It is always a relief to have the tramites guys leave, no matter who they are. After that we had a service project at Nacho's house. We cut trees and trimmed bushes and picked lemons. Services is always good because you know you are helping someone. We ate lunch at a member's restaurant. They food was very bolivian and Rumualdo even got a chicken foot. We went home for a second and found out we didn't have water. We had to go all around looking for water trucks. It took like 2 hours. At night we had a lesson with the Flia Castro. They are great, but they need to progress a little more. We'll keep going though. We raced the Hnas to the chapel, where we had our mission meeting. We had a good meeting and then ended the day with dinner. A good day. Long, but good cause we were busy.</p>

                    <p>Wow, last day of August. I remember my first August in the mission. It took forever. This one just flew by. Today was actually a good Sunday. Church was normal, but it is the first time that I didn't fall asleep while in Ingavi. Ward counsel was pretty good too. The ward is actually getting better. We also got a reference from the Cobija hnas that is supposedly golden, so that was good. We had lunch with the bishop's family, which was surprisingly fun. I thought the bishop was scary, but he is actually pretty nice. In the afternoon we had a lesson with an investigator named Maria. She's nice, but is more interested in just talking to us. Randomly the 2nd counselor invited us over, so we went. We couldn't imagine why he wanted to talk to us, but when we got there we found out he wanted help on his USA visa stuff. Odd service project... To finish the day we talked to Genoveva and Teresa. Genoveva is a recent convert and her daughter Teresa is recently activated. They're awesome. The day went by super fast, but that's how it goes if you have stuff to do.</p>

                    <h3>September 1, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Today was a solid p-day. We got up and at 8 Elder Porter and Elder Berrett showed up at our house. We went with them, Elder Phillips and Elder Grigor to Quillacollo to play basketball. We played on a woodcourt (kinda) with Obispo Davila, his brother, and his brother's friend. His brother used to play semi-pro. It was really fun. I miss basketball. I played pretty well too. After that we headed back home. I got called like 11 times before noon because not all the payments had gone through, so people were missing money. It was really annoying. We had a zone activity at the chapel after. We had a BBQ and played soccer. It was simple, but it was still fun. After that we went to the office to do email. Everything is going well at home. Griffin's MTC comp is the state chess comp and kinda nerdy and weird, but Griff is trying. He's already changed a good amount, it's pretty cool. I am feeling really stressed tonight though. I don't know why, but it feels really weird. I really hope that I can get back to feeling normal soon.</p>
