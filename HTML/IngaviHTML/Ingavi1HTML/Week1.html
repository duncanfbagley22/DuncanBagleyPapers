            <h1>Week 1 <small>(August 18, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>3 Worlds, 1 Family</h3>
            <p><small>Dear family,<br>
   I hope you all had a good week. It is kinda weird that now Griffin
is in Mexico. These last 14 months have gone by really fast. When I
left I even had a little bit of doubt as to if he would go or not, but
he changed a lot. Blessings of a mission. Anyways, I am sure that you
are all still sad about him going, but I will try to cheer you up with
a somewhat entertaining letter. Here it is...<br>
Monday- Just normal, I think I explained it last week too.<br>
Tuesday- I had to wake up at...2:45am!!! I had to go with my new
companion Elder Christensen to the airport to send all the old
missionaries home. Needless to say, up until Sunday we were still
feeling the effects of getting up early. I was sad to see some of
these guys go, as they´d been my zone leaders and stuff like that.
Directly after, we picked up the new gringo missionaries. There were
8, which is a pretty big group. Me and Elder Prado took them to the
hotel, to go get tramites pictures, and then to the mission home for
their interviews. We basically ran all over town. At night we picked
up the latinos, and just took them to the hotel. That night we ate
some giant pizzas with all of them.<br>
Wednesday- We had to be at the hotel at 7:45 to get everything started
for the new guys. We had to get the latinos through their interviews
and all that. After that, we took them to go get pictures, and then we
all went to walk around the temple for a bit. After that we had lunch
with everyone. The new guys also got their trainers. We have a new
record of 6 gringo companionships in the whole mission, which is
really weird to those of us who have been here a while. Us 4 and the
APs (Elder Weekes and Saad) served lunch and then I got to eat with
some of the new missionaries and their trainers. It seems like Pres
Hansen is looking towards the future by selecting great missionaries
as trainers. After lunch we had a meeting with all of them. That is
where we explain to them our jobs and what they need to do,
logistically speaking. I think I have built up a reputation enough now
that even when I say things that arent funny, people still just laugh.
That just assume I am going to say something funny. After the meeting
we just went to the offices, and then ended the day eating tacos with
the people going to Sucre and Potosi. It was another long day.<br>
Thursday- We first went to the airport to send some people to Sucre.
After that us 2, along with 16 other missionaries from the stake, went
to this fair and set up a little booth and tried to contact some
people. We contacted so many people. If we do this in a more crowded
area, we could contact hundreds of people. It was cool to just walk
around and see literally everyone holding some sort of church
material. After that we just went to the office and worked for the
rest of the day. I had all of the Zone Leaders come. It is weird
because there are a few new ones and I have to explain how things work
to them. It was good though.<br>
Friday- In the morning we had zone meeting. It was good to meet all
the new people in the zone. It didnt really change that much, but
there are a few new people. Everyone always has to present themselves
in front of everyone, and that is always funny. We still have a great
zone, so it should be another fun 6 weeks. The rest of the day we just
stayed in the office and worked.<br>
Saturday- This was my first day actually working in my new area,
Ingavi. For the first 7 hours, we couldnt find anything. No one was
home or in the street, or they didnt want to talk to us. Finally, we
found something though. We knocked on a door of some people who we had
a teaching record for. They dont live there anymore, but there is a
family staying there. I tried to speak spanish to them, cause they
looked pretty latino, but he asked if I would please speak english.
Turns out, they are from India and only speak english. They invited us
in and we got to know them. They are missionaries from some other
church, but they seem more like service missionaries. They are
SOOOOOOOOOO nice, and seem open. We are going by tonight to see them
again. We both just have a really good feeling about them. They are
the Kawldingliana family. Then we went to teach a recent convert, and
then to the ward mission meeting. It was probably the best day of the
week.<br>
Sunday- Now I have church at 8...I liked 10 better. We went to church,
but it is weird cause I dont really know anyone. Plus, people are a
little bit dead in that ward. It will take some adjusting though. I
miss Cobija. We had lunch with this family from Santa Cruz, and it was
super fun.  They gave us so much food though. We went around looking
for people and taught a few lessons. We didnt have much this week, but
we have a full schedule for next week. We have some potential for
sure.<br>
Monday- We went up into the mountains and played in the snow, no
really. We saw some llamas and it was really fun.
It was a stressful week, but things are looking brighter. Hope you
guys have a great week, and I will talk to you next monday.<br>
Love,<br>
Elder Bagley</small></p>

                        <p>What a long day. First off, it was my parents' 25th anniversary, so here's to them. We got up at 3 to go drop the missionaries off to go home. I'm gonna miss a lot of those guys, even though they were really tronki. Elder Jarrell, Elder Singer, Elder Robertson. We lost some good missionaries. We stayed at the airport until 8:30. We picked up the 8 new gringos and we helped them out with the hotel and interviews and stuff. Even though our taxi driver got lost going to the temple, we stayed good to the schedule. I spent a good time at the mission home talking to Hna Sonia which was good. Then we ate lunch at Luigi's and went to the office. I was super tired. I fell asleep for a bit at my desk. The stupid flickering light doesn't help though. After working, and playing nerf basketball with Weekes and Saad, we picked up the 9 latinos. On the ride I just talked to Leonor, the airport lady. To end the night, we just ate interminables with everyone. Elder Tia, a big Samoan, ate like 12 pieces, but he said he wasn't hungry. This seems like a good group of missionaries. They are going to have great trainers too, so it'll be fun to see what happens. I am so tired now, so I'll go to sleep now.</p>

                        <p>To start things off, Griffin entered the MTC. I'm so excited/nervous. He'll be great though. Today we had more cambio stuff. I had to take people to the stake center for their interviews. We showed up perfectly on time, so that was good. I hung around, setting up the email and organizing things. Also telling Hna Ninataype that she's from the ghetto. After that we went to do the pictures and then to the temple. After going around the temple, we went to the mission home. We found out that <u>3</u> gringos are training gringos, and 2 are in our zone. Both E Valerio and E Skousen are training gringos. There are 6 gringo companionships in the mission now. We served lunch, and then I ate with E Ortiz, E Rosario, and E Mero and their comps. We went to the stake center after and had the presentation meeting. To end the day, we just went to the office and then to the hotel to eat with the people going out of Cocha. People like Elder Tia and Elder Villa who are cool. Overall, a long day, and I am just super tired now.</p>

                        <p>We actually did some work today. We went to the airport to drop the out of Cocha guys off at the airport. After that we went to the park with all the ZLs and DLs in the stake to do a giant kiosk with Hno Nacho. I'm pretty sure we contacted every single person there. I personally didn't find anyone, but with 18 missionaries we got some work done. If we could do it in a more crowded place, we'd get so many references. It felt good to at least do a little bit of work. In the afternoon I met with the ZLs. It's weird because they're new (some at least). I still get along well with them though. That is the basic of what we did today. It was fun to go contact with Elder christensen again after more than a year. I really do think that me and him can get some work done here in Barrio Ingavi.</p>

                      <p>Today was pretty normal I guess. We studied normal and all that. Me and Elder Christensen did our companionship study in spanish, which is kind of weird. After that, and passing by the office, we went to the district/zone meeting. It was all good. We had to present ourselves to the zone, which is always fun. I found out that there is a huge rivalry between Brazil and Argentina. Hna Paiva and Elder Reina were going at it. After lunch we just went to the office. It was a rather uneventful day in the office, but that's fine. At the end of the day, we went to the chapel to pick up dinner. There was also a talen show going on. I saw 2 people from Jardin. 1 was on stage performing. The other was this kid named Arnold. He was E' Gubler's convert, and he surprisingly remembered my name. Overall, it was a pretty calm day. We've been really tired lately, so hopefully I'll have more energy tomorrow.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <p>Today started out slow, but it ended great. We did all of the studying and stuff like that in the morning. We worked from about 11-1, but we didn't really find anything. It always takes me a little while to get used to a new area. So I'm in that transition right now. We had lunch with the Flia Antonio. They are a super cool family. The husband especially was just super funny. From about 3-6, we still didn't find anyone. However, we went to this house of old investigators from about 3 yrs ago. I knocked on the door and started speaking spanish. The guy asked me to speak english though, so I did. We talked and found out they are from India. They invited us in an we talked for a bit. They're super nice, the nicest people ever. The are service presbyterian missionaries. The husband is Albert Kawdlingliang or something like that. We just feel <u>really</u> good about these guys for some reason. We'll see what happens. We then visited a recent convert, had our meeting with the WML, then we went home. A slow start, but the Indian family could possibly be really good.</p>

                    <p>My first Sunday in Ingavi. Today we went to church at 8. Just that requires adjustment. We got there and I realized that everything is different. I hardly knew anyone, and I sat by myself. Sacrament meeting was good enough. Gospel Principles had a lot of people, which is good. Elders Quorum was fairly boring. We had ward council after, and I realized this ward is kinda dry. You can't feel any love there. We'll try to get something going though. After church we had lunch with the Flia Garcia. They are from Santa Cruz and they're super nice. We had a good time and we were laughing a lot. They gave us so much food that I was full the rest of the night. After that we visited 2 less actives. Firstly, Hermana Escobar. She's old, and kinda crazy, but nice. We taught the Plan of Salvation basically. Christensen said that she has progressed a lot. To end the night, we talked to Santiago. He's a young guy and has a lot of doubts, but we had a good lesson. Overall, it's weird being in a new ward, but there's a bit of potential.</p>

                    <h3>August 18, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Today was a fun p-day. The plan was to go play kickball at 2, but the plans changed last minute. At 8 the ZLs called and said that at 9:30 we were going to Tunari. That meant that me and Jerry had to go to the Cobija Hnas' house to tell them, because they had lost their phone. After a long, 2ish hour bus ride, we got to Tunari. It is like a national park type place in the mountains, and on the way we saw wild llamas and stuff. Up in the park there was a lake, mountains, and snow to play in. It was super fun. The trufi rides there and back were terrible, but it was a fun experience all together. After we got back, we went and did internet and then we left to go to an appointment. We went back to teach the Indian family. Not as perfect this time. He had a hard time with the apostasy, and is SUPER set on the bible (he has a masters degree in the New Testament). It'll be a slow process, but I think we can get there. It was a good day all together. I love Zona Cobija.</p>
