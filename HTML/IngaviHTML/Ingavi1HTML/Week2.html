            <h1>Week 2 <small>(August 25, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Rome wasn´t built in one day</h3>
            <p><small>Dear family,<br>
     This was a tiring week. Lots of things going on in the office
mixed with us working in the field...we got home every night dead
tired. However, we have set up a lot of good things for this next
week. I hit 14 months this week. Not exactly a big milestone, but it
lead to a bit of thinking. I sat there one day and I started to get
scared. I cant really imagine being home, and I am sure that after 10
months more here it´ll be even worse. Even though the mission is hard
sometimes, I am so used to it here that I think it will be hard to
ever go home. Not that I plan on living forever in Bolivia, but I am
literally a little bit scared because the time is going super fast.
Anyways, I have to take advantage of the time I have, so this is what
we did this week to accomplish that:<br><br>

Monday- We had the lesson with the indian people. Not as great as last
time. He has sooooooo many questions. He also loves the bible (he has
a masters degree in the New Testament). We didnt feel so good about
them this time, but Elder Christensen made a good point that last time
we could see there potential, we now know what the path is to getting
there. We will keep going with them though.<br><br>

Tuesday- We had a great district meeting. Elder Christensen taught
about working with the members and getting references. It is something
that we learn about all the time, but for some reason it really caught
my attention. The spirit was great and I learned that we really need
to go through the members more. I was also watching a movie on David O
McKay this week, and he talked about member missionaries like 50 years
ago. It is time for the members to get in on the work. I realized that
if every member accounted for one baptism a year, the whole world
would be baptized by 2023. So everyone that is reading my letter, go
out and give a reference. Pray about it, and then go tell the
missionaries. They will greatly appreciate it.<br><br>

Wednesday- Just in the office all day. Nothing too exciting. I went to
the bank and took out a good chunk of mission money. Every time I do
that it makes me realize that they trust me a lot. Not every 20yr old
white kid in Bolivia goes and takes out tons of money every week. I
trust myself too though, so I wont go do anything bad. At night we had
a spur of the moment FHE with the Hnas in our ward (Capito and
Rumualdo) and the Flia Quiñonez. The dad has been sick for a long
time, so they havent gone to church. They are great people though, and
the dad is super funny. We have another FHE with them next Wednesday.<br><br>

Thursday- We started out playing basketball in the morning with a few
of the zone leaders that were staying in our house. It was really fun,
and I miss basketball. The whole day we had the mission leadership
council. We arent technically leaders, but we were there for an hour
or so because we had to give a presentation. I realized that one
important thing in my job is to be in good standing with the zone
leaders, which I think I am. Every presentation I include a funny
opening picture ($100 bill with my face on it or this time a cat
holding money). I also include little jokes just to keep them awake.
It has produced results though, because I havent really had any
problems with zone leaders and they all seem to like me. It´s a really
weird part of my job. Also, in just sitting and waiting I caught the
end of a lesson. Elder Saad, one of the APs, said that we all have
testimonies. We wouldnt be in the mission for over a year if we didnt.
The spirit hit my like a brick wall, so it was a good thing I was
there.<br><br>

Friday- I expected to have little to no work to do on Friday, but as I
got to the office I got a phone call from the area office in Lima. I
guess there was something that was supposed to be classified in one
place, but it wasnt, and I never knew. They said I had to urgently fix
it. That gave me something to do for the rest of the day. I got a
little scared because it reminded me that my job is pretty important,
and if I do it wrong there are some big consequences. This situation
wasnt really my fault, but I dont want to ever get a call from Lima
because something is my fault. We couldnt really find anything to do
at night. We get so stressed in the office, that working in the field
is second in importance. Hard part is is that it really has to be that
way. I cant wait to be a regular missionary some day, just to worry
about investigators, instead of investigators, missionaries, president
hansen, and money.<br><br>

Saturday- We had to go to the office for a few things in the morning.
For lunch, we ate with the Flia Cortez. I had heard rumors about them,
that they give a lot of food. A lot a alot. It is true. We had like a
pot of soup, huge piles of potatoes, meat, and vegetables, and then we
had dessert 3 times. I finished, but just barely. Luckily the soup was
Sopa de Mani (best thing ever) or I wouldnt have been able to. Member
lunchs are our chance to build good relationships in the ward, so that
is my goal every time. After not much going on in the afternoon, we
actually had some good things at night. We taught 2 lessons with less
active people, Sara then Santiago. Sara hasnt gone to church in
forever, but wants to go back. She doesnt know anyone though, so she
needs a friend. Santiago has soooo many doubts, but we are working
hard with him. To end the night we taught the Flia Castro. The son,
Gustavo, is the Exec Secretary of the ward, but the parents arent
members. They are super nice though. The dad shows a lot of potential.<br><br>

Sunday- I am still trying to get used to the new ward. It´ll be
another few weeks before it is 100% normal. We had lunch with the 2nd
counselors family. He is a convert, which is pretty cool. They are
pretty quiet, but we eventually got a conversation going and I think
they like us. Bishopric members are always important. After lunch we
couldnt find anything. We didnt sit down for like 3 hours. We did
contact a lady that seems great. We asked if she would like to hear
our message and she said it is the perfect time to have God back in
her life. Her brother is a member too, so she has potential. We will
keep a close watch on her. At the end of the day we finally had a
lesson with Margarita Chacon. Fun fact, her son is serving a mission
in Guayaquil Norte, so Griffin will definitely meet him. She isnt a
member. She likes the church, but she promised her mom once that she
would stay catholic, so that is the primary problem. We will see where
things go though.<br><br>

It was a tiring week. We fell asleep at like 10 every night because we
were so tired. We didnt really have any major successes, but I kept on
remembering a quote that our good friend Lebron James said at the
beginning of his time in Miami (leave it to me to use the NBA in my
letter home). He said that Rome wasnt built in one day. I applied that
to us here, that we cant have all the success at the beginning. It
requires weeks of work to get something going. We are going to work
though, and I am sure success will come. I love you guys, and I will
talk to you next week.<br>
Love,<br>
   Elder Bagley</small></p>

                        <p>Well, I completed 14 months today. This is going really fast. Today was just a regular day. We studied all normal in the morning, and then we passed by the office to do some flights or something. After that we went to the district meeting. This was probably Elder Christensen's best class. He taught about working with the members and getting references from them. It is something that I've learned about plenty of times, but this time is was different. I left the class really excited about working and I could feel the Spirit. I hope all the classes can be like that. After lunch I just had my financiero meetings with all the zone leaders. Every Tuesday I leave my seat for like 5min every 2 hours. That makes for very long days. Anyways, it was a good day. I only have 10 months left, so I think I am on the downward slope.</p>

                        <p>Today was pretty boring. Griffin finished his first week in the CCM, just 103 more. The morning was pretty normal. We just studied all normally. I am currently reading Doctrine and Covenants, and I usually study any random topic that comes to my head. We had to go to the bank. I took out 15,000bs ($2000). Not a ton of money, but just enough to make me realize that I had a big responability. I'm a 20yr old kid with no experience handling large sums of money. After spending the whole day in the office, we left around 6 to go to some "appts". They all fell through though, so we walked around just looking for something to do. We ended up at the Quionez house just as the Hnas were knocking the door. We decided to join them and we had a joint lesson with the family. They're cool people, but the dad has been sick so they haven't gone to church. We have an FHE next week with them. I am slowly adjusting to Ingavi, but I'll get there.</p>

                        <p>Today started well, because me, Christensen, E Crankshaw, E Rhoton, E Atwood, and E Kenney went to go play basketball. It was fun. I really really miss playing all the time. After that we had the consejo de lideres. We ate lunch there and gave our little presentations. As always, I put a funny picture at the beginning and everyone laughed. A cool part of the consejo was that I got to listen to the regular stuff for a little bit. Elder Saad said something cool. He reminded us that we have been out here for over a year and we wouldn't be if we didn't have testimonies. That stuck with me. When we got back to the office, I got a call from the area office in Lima. This guy said that for the past 7 month we've been doing something wrong, and I needed to fix it. Anytime Lima calls we know it is important. We basically stayed in the office the rest of the day. It was a good day I guess. Really busy, but for the most part that is usually a good thing.</p>

                      <p>Today wasn't a very interesting day. In the morning we went to the airport to send all of the zone leaders back to Sucre. Pretty glad to have them gone just so life can be calm again. The rest of my day was basically spent doing President Hansen's finances. With Pres Dyer it could take 3 hours to finish all the paperwork, but with Pres Hansen I can finish in 30min. I tried to explain everything to him by phone, but he ended up coming down to the office so I could explain to him in purpose. I think he really appreciates us, well at least me and Elder Christensen. We aren't perfect, but we do a good job. I get scared that he is so comfortable with us that he'll never let us leave the office. The only other thing from today is my office light. It flickers constantly, but I tried to get up and fix it and I couldn't. I keep my lights off until I literally can't see because it is so annoying. Oh well, such is life.<br><br><br><br></p>

                    <p>Today started slow but it ended well. We got up at 5:30 to go to the airport. We had to send... Elder Gallegos home. I guess he has some family problems and stuff and felt like he needed to go home. It was sad to see him go. For lunch we went to the Flia Cortez. They're really cool. They made <u>a lot</u> of food though. Soup, segundo, and like 3 desserts. I barely finished it all. After lunch we went back to the office, did kiosk for about 30min, and then we went out to work. We had a few lessons. First we talked to Sara Escobar, a less active. She just needs some friends in the church, then she'll come back. After her we talked to Santiago Torres. He is less active and has lots of problems and doubts in his life. We are just helping him through that for now. Finally we taught the Flia Castro. The son is a member, but the parents aren't. They are really nice and accepting, but they just lack a bit of iniciative. They have potential though. 3 lessons made for an above-average day.</p>

                    <p>I've written this before, but I'm always most tired on Sundays. Today was no different. Church was normal. The people are at least starting to realize that we switched. One weird this is that our EQ pres dances around the room when he teaches. We ate lunch with the 2nd counselors family. Kind of a quiet family, but they're nice. He's a convert too, which is cool. After lunch, we went out to work, but we couldn't find much. We looked for less actives, but we could find them, old investigators didn't live where we thought, appts fell through and everything. Shining moment of the afternoon was contacting this lady who said it was time to find God. She already knew about the church and wants us to visit. At night we taught Margarita Chacon. Her son is in Guayaquial (Griffin's mission) as a missionary. She isn't a member though. She promised her mom she'd stay catholic, so that is our main challenge now. She has potential, but she likes her Catholic roots. Overall, I'm 2 weeks in to the new area and at least there's a glimmer of hope.</p>

                    <p>Being companions with Elder Christensen has been fun, but one consequence is that I go to the airport like every other day. Today we went to send someone to Villazon for an emergency cambio. After that we went to Hipermaxi, the supermarket, to buy some food. After Hipermaxi, we went to the office to do email. I got Griffin's first mission email. Kind of a weird feeling. He sounds good though. We ate lunch with the zone at IC Norte, and then we went up to Villa Graciela to play kickball with Sacaba. It was SUPER windy, like the most I've seen on my mission. We destroyed in kickball, 13-1. I had a nice diving catch. We also played soccer, where we won 9-1. Our zone is just the best. I accidentally kicked the ball over the fence and almost lost it. It landed in some house's yard, but we finally got some kid to answer the door and he found it. The rest of the day was just spent in the office. It was a good p-day, and we finally showed that 100% without a doubt, Cobija is the best zone in the mission.</p>
