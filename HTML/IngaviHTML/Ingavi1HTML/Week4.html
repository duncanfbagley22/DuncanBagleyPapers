            <h1>Week 4 <small>(September 8, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Under Pressure</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
   I know that the title implies somewhat negative things, but dont
worry, all is well. This was a super quick week. I dont know how or
why it went by so fast. It wasnt exactly the most interesting week,
but there really arent very many interesting weeks in the office. I
will try my best to make it sound exciting though. Anyways, this is
what happened:<br><br>

Tuesday- This is the reason as to why I was under pressure. I got an
email the other day from my boss, Eddy Rocha. He said that he and
another guy were going to come visit me on Tuesday. He works in the
offices in Santa Cruz, and he is basically incharge of the church´s
money in Bolivia. That makes him important. He came at 1, meaning we
had to eat lunch later as well. I wasnt really scared of him coming,
but you always get a little bit nervous in situations like this. They
stayed for a good 2 or 3 hours, just asking questions, telling me
things, and stuff like that. I think I made a good impression. They
said that I am doing a good job and all that. Most of the good things
are just what Elder Gallegos taught me, but I guess I am doing a good
job. I think them, along with Pres Hansen, are pretty glad that I am
in the office. I am glad too, at least most the time. I was really
glad to have them leave, just to get the pressure gone. It was a super
long day. That morning we got up at 5 to go to the airport for random
things. With the office visit, we didnt eat lunch until 5. With a
district meeting and my meetings with the zone leaders, it made a very
long day. The other days just paled in comparison.<br><br>

Wednesday- Nothing super special. I just went to the bank and just did
random office stuff. I feel like this is what regular people feel like
with their 9-5 office jobs.<br><br>

Thursday- Really, the only cool thing was doing service at night.
There is a family that lives like a block away from us. I probably
have talked about them before. The dad´s name is Nacho and is super
cool. He is the stake mission leader. His family just loves the
missionaries. Me and Elder Christensen went and trimmed the bushes and
stuff. We decided we are going to have a landscaping business back
home. We also had a fun time afterwards, throwing lemons up in the air
and cutting them in half with machetes. Service might not get us
numbers, but it at least makes me feel good.<br><br>

Friday- Almost as boring as wednesday. I went to the bank...TWICE!
Exciting right. It also rained. I had a good talk at night with Elder
Saad, one of the APs, just about mission stuff. It was a pretty
relaxed day. We have some tramites guys here, Elder Villa and Elder
Barahona, so at least a little change to the norm...<br><br>

Saturday- It has been a little tough lately, just because we dont have
much going on. Elder Christensen is starting to get tired of being in
the office too. We are trying to push through the drought in the area
though. The member we were supposed to have lunch with had something
come up, so she just gave us money and we ate by ourselves. Pretty
boring lunch. We did a lot of contacting, just talking to people and
knocking doors. It sucks because everytime we contact someone good,
they live in another area. We had a lesson with a guy named Santiago,
who is a less active. He is slowly, like really slowly, progressing.
He knows that there is something special about us, but he is just not
willing to change right now. We felt good after the lesson though,
just cause we can see a glimmer of hope.<br><br>

Sunday- Church was... interesting. Our elders quorum president is a
piece of work. He basically dances as he teaches because he gets so
into it. It was getting heated in elders quorum because he thought he
was losing control of the lesson, while everyone else was super
confused as to what he was teaching. Anytime anyone would comment, he
would look at his watch and just look annoyed. I left the class
laughing at the end, just cause it is all so weird. At least he is
energetic... We had 2 good lessons. We have this investigator named
Maria (everyone is named Maria). She seemed like the kind of old lady
that just likes to talk. We didnt have high expectations, but we went
anyways. We fought, figuratively speaking, for like 20 minutes, just
trying to find out how to help her. All of the sudden she just asked
us to help he to stop smoking. BINGO. We explained a few things and it
was a really good lesson. But... she then told us she will be out of
town until October. I hate when that happens. Ah well, we will go
visit her later. The other one was with Margarita, the lady whose son
is in Griffin´s mission. We talked about the Book of Mormon and read a
little bit. She just needs to decide to act of the things that we
teach her. This lesson was a lot better than the last one though.<br><br>

All of the references that we thought were going to work this week
fell through on us, which was kind of disappointing. We have some
things for this coming week though, so that should be good. This week
have some more pressure as well. Elder Waddell of the 70 is coming to
visit, and we are incharge of setting things up. Plus, Wednesday we
are going to the airport to send him and the Hansens to Sucre, so we
will meet him up close and personal. It should be good to learn from
him though, I am excited. We havent had anyone come to our mission in
about a year, and he was just an area 70. Things are slowly but surely
picking up here. We are working hard, just waiting for something good
to happen. I love you all so much, and I hope everything is going
well. I´ll talk to you next week.<br><br>
Love,<br>
  Elder Duncan Bagley

                        <p>Today was stressful. The morning was pretty normal. We woke up at like 5 because tramites people got the house (we also went to the airport). For anyone else that'd be weird, but that's pretty normal for me now. After studying in the morning, we went to the district meeting. We learned about diligence and patience. We didn't stay for the zone meeting though, because today my boss came. Eddy Rocha, the guy in charge of money for the church in Bolivia, stopped by to visit. He just wanted to make sure I'm doing good and to answer any questions that I had. I really was nervous, but after talking with him, I think I'm doing a pretty good job. Not to be prideful, but I can tell now why Pres Dyer picked me. I've been well prepared to do this job. I'm not perfect though, and I have a long ways to go. For the rest of the day, it was still pretty busy. We ended up eating lunch at 4:30. I finished the day with the regular zone leader meetings. I was emotionally tired today. Just exhausted. Days where we get up at 5, eat lunch at 4:30, and are constantly working just make me tired.</p>

                        <p>Today was a lot less stressful than yesterday. It really was like all the happiness was sucked out of me. It took a while, but I got back to normal. The mission is pretty draining. As I said, today was pretty low-key. We didn't really have too much going on I went to the bank like always. I'm getting so used to the bank that I recognize almost everyone who works there. I also had more meetings with zone leaders, one that couldn't do it yesterday. Still some pretty boring stuff. Elder Christensen is starting to get tired of being secretary. I get tired of it sometimes, and I only have 3 months. It's a hard job. We do the behind-the-scenes work and anything that needs doing. It doesn't give you the same feeling as a regular missionary. I always thought the office would be easy, but it's not. People don't expect much of us and they think we're lazy. We aren't really the same kind of missionary as before, and I miss that.</p>

                        <p>Today was relatively normal. I can't really think of anything special that happened in the morning. Just regular work most of the day. I've realized that I can basically finish all of my work by the end of Thursday. I usually get bored during the week though, so I end up taking longer. It's hard, being in an office all by myself. I've realized how easy it would be to not be obedient. I'm not perfect. I thought it'd be easier to be obedient, but it's not; the office takes a toll on me. One good thing that happened today was we did service again at Nacho's house. Me and Christensen trimmed the bushes. It was actually fun somehow. I almost died when Hna Rumualdo almost pulled me off a ladder. After we finished, me and Christensen went Fruit Ninja style. We threw lemons up in the air and cut them in half with machetes. It was a good feeling. Doing service is always a good thing, you don't feel lazy and you get to help people.</p>

                      <p>Today was a little bit frustrating. The morning was fun because we went and played soccer. Us 4, the Hnas, and Elder Villa and Elder Barahona, who are here for tramites. The rest of the day was pretty normal. The biggest problem that we are having is that Elder Christensen is starting to get tired of being in the office. He's been pretty depressed lately. I had to go to the bank twice today, because the first time we went I forgot to take the deposit form. I went with Prado the 2nd time. On the way back it was raining pretty hard. We starting to enter spring/summer, so it's going to start raining and it's gonna be hot. I had a good talk with Elder Saad, just talking about the mission. Saad's a great guy, and helps a lot. We could tell Christensen was pretty down though. I wanna try to help him, but I'm not quite sure how. That'll probably be my goal for the next few days.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <p>Today was more frustration. I just had to try not to annoy Elder Christensen during most of the day. He is still a little down about being in the office so long. Our lunch cancelled on us, so we ate at Wistupiku. We didn't talk really at all. I would've tried, but he scares me sometimes. After lunch we ended up at the house, where accidentally fell asleep for a bit. However, we left reenergized to go work. We went and tried to contact. It was as better use of time that sleeping. People here are a little hard to contact, cause they're rich. We did find a few people willing to listen to us at least. At night we had a good lesson with Santiago. He's better everything and basically explained that we bring the spirit, but he is slow to change. I felt really good about the lesson. Not much else happened the rest of the nigh. The work presses on here in Ingavi. Eventually something good will come.</p>

                    <p>Today was just a regular Sunday. Church went as usual. Elders Quorum was pretty funny. The Elder Quorum President was getting pretty annoyed with the class. It all just turned into an arguement type of thing, and I still have no idea what the lesson was on. He's an interesting guy. We had lunch with the Flia Antonio. They're a super cool family, plus they've been members for a long time. We had 2 lessons in the afternoon. First we taught Maria Ogenia. At first, we didn't see much potential, but it got better. After searching and searching for something she needs, we found out she wants to stop smoking. We talked about that a little bit. It was a solid lesson, only problem is that a she leaves tomorrow for La Paz for a month. At night we taught Margarita Chacon. She was a lot better this time. We talked about the BoM and it went well. Overall, it was a good day. It was "dia de peaton", where you can't use anything with a motor. Surprisingly fun. P-day tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>Well, we didn't have an activity for p-day, but it was still fun. We played soccer in the morning. Us 4, the 4 Hermanas, and Barahona and Villa. It was really fun. I scored a cool little ninja kick goal that was pretty cool. While leaving, I threw the ball at Rumualdo and almost took her head off (I may have accidentally thrown it too hard.) I got back home and I felt weird. The peripheral vision in my left eye went away and I couldn't see anything, that was really weird. It got back to normal though. Internet was good, just normal. After that I went to a chinese food place with Christensen, Valerio, Stoker, Harwood, Long, and Bradford. It was fun to hang out with those guys. It ended weird because we got a note from 2 girls as they were leaving that said "llamame, Estefi" followed by 2 numbers. Kinda weird. We went to go to Bumper Cars, but it was closed. We ended jup just going to the "Cancha" with Valerio and Stoker. The Cancha is just a huge open market that sells everything. I just bought one tie, but it would be super easy to go crazy with money. I'll do that when I get home. After the Cancha we just went to the office. Oh ya, there was this weird preacher guy that talked to us about weird stuff. It was an interesting/fun/weird day to say the least.</p>
