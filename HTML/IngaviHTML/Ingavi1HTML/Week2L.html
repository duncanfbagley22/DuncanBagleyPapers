President Hansen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were busy again this week. The consejo de lideres gave us a lot of things to do. We had some good plans for working in the field, but a few things came up and took some time away. Working in the office is a bit difficult at times, because we have to juggle the office work with the field work, and at times it can be difficult. The good thing is that Elder Christensen is really driven, and helps to keep me going. We really are pretty good complements. He helps me have a higher drive and to keep me going, and I think I help him relax and things like that when he gets stressed. It worked the same way in the MTC as well. We are slowly but surely building things up in the area. It is hard to have appointments fall through or people reject us, but we are finding a few good people. Yesterday we had a good experience. We were looking for less actives from a list that we have. We didnt find this guy because he moved, but his sister lived there. We were a bit tired and not 100% focused, so we almost left without contacting her. However, I think we both had something telling us that we needed to talk to her, at least I did. We asked if she would be interested in our message, and she said that she needs more of God in her life. She has been going through a hard time recently, and knows that God can help. She also already knows about Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon. We are hopefully going back later this week to see her. I am glad that we listened to the Spirit to contact her. We know that building success is a long process, but we are going to continue towards it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>Thank you for everything.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Bagley

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, we recently found something that caught our attention here in the office. Elder Christensen recently came into my office to show me something. I guess him and the assistants found a small notebook that Elder Calderon is preparing for the person that replaces him. It actually is a great idea, because there are a lot of small details that our replacements will need to know. However, we found one comment that isnt right. He wrote "Si el secretario financiero no te da dinero necesario... Nunca reveles tu ultima carta bajo la manga: Presupuesto directo del presidente (hacerlo confidencialmente)". I am not really a fan of going behind peoples´backs or telling on people, but this is a concern to me. That really isnt how it should work in the office. He basically is saying that if I dont give him money, the answer is to go behind my back and ask you secretly. I am bringing this to your attention just so that you are aware if it becomes a problem. I guess in the past, a secretary did that and it led to a 50000bs payment for furniture that the financial secretary was unaware of. It is important that I know where money is going so we can keep a good mission budget. We should never have any secrets in the office or stuff like that. I know that we shouldnt have read into Elder Calderon´s stuff, but I think it is important that we found it. Let me know if you have any questions.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>Thank you so much,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Bagley

Thanks for sharing your experience in the Aug 25 letter about being tired but nevertheless inviting the sister of the man you had come to visit to listen to the message. That's a great example of how a missionary should always be trying to find new people to teach.
<br>
Thanks for sharing with me the concern over the inappropriate note in Elder Calderon's book of notes for his successor. I agree that all financial decisions should be made openly with the Sec. de Finanzas.
