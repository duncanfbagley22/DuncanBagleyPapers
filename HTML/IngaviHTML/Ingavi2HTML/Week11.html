            <h1>Week 11 <small>(October 27, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Past, Present, and Future</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
    This was a great week. Not just in the office (I don´t know if you
can really have a great week in the office, they´re just stressful or
not stressful) but in the field as well. I started to feel like a
missionary again. We had a great week working in the field with
lessons and new people and all that good stuff. My title for this
email isnt quite as funny or clever as usual, but it fit pretty well,
so I just went with it. I will explain in the letter. Anyways, this is
what happened during the week.
<br><br>
Monday- Nothin special that I didnt write last week
<br><br>
Tuesday- Just a regular Tuesday for the most part. However, at night
we did do something different. Elder Christensen´s convert from his
old ward was going through the temple to do baptisms for the first
time, and we got to go to the temple to go with her. Me and Davis were
kinda like tag alongs, but I´m not going to turn down a chance to go
to the temple. It was great to be in the temple, and I got to work the
camera and mark off baptisms. My first time being a recorder (not sure
if that´s what it´s called) in the temple. I also got to thinking
about how the temple is our goal as missionaries. Lots of people just
look at baptisms, but ultimately we need to get people to the temple.
Got me excited to get to the field again, so I can send people to the
temple.
<br><br>
Wednesday- Nothin special
<br><br>
Thursday- Just running around the office and doing fun stuff. We ate
lunch at 3 cause we were so busy. We always tried to convince Hermana
Hansen to take us to the jungle in December for Christmas, but she
wouldnt budge.
<br><br>
Friday- Interviews!!! I got to have an interview with President Hansen
on Friday. This is the FUTURE part of my email. The first thing we
talked about was my time in the office. He also told me *SPOILER* that
I will be leaving the offices in December, and that my replacement
should come in the next 2-3 weeks. He asked me for some suggestions,
so I told him about a few guys that could do it. Then we just talked
about me and it was more him asking me questions about what he and the
office can do better. He gave me a whole bunch of compliments and you
can tell that he really appreciates me here. It made me feel really
good. He´s a very serious guy, but if you are on his good side he´s
great.
<br><br>
Saturday- First off, the PAST part of the email. So in like a week or
so, Bolivia is completing its 50 year anniversary of having the church
here. As part of that, there was a big exposition thing in the biggest
plaza here. All of the wards set up booths and we worked a kiosk to
talk to potential investigators. It went great. There were a bunch of
interested people, and the best part of all was that just 2 booths
away from us was Barrio Jardin´s booth. I got to see a bunch of people
from that ward. I talked to the bishop and realized how great the
leaders were in that ward. Also, Rosella and Rodrigo (converts from El
Paso) were there cause Rosella cooked some stuff for the booth. I
talked to her for a while. She´s doing great. She´s had a calling for
a while and is proud of being very active. I was hoping to be able to
get them to go to the temple so we could go with them, but I found out
she´s already gone a few times. She´s doing as great as I could hope
for. The ward has lackluster missionaries right now, so El Paso is
suffering, but hopefully something will get goign soon. We went out to
work later on Saturday. The most important lesson was with the Flia
Villarroel. They were a reference from the Gospel Principles teacher,
and they are really cool. They were receptive and we have another
appointment with them on Friday I think. This is part of the PRESENT
part.
<br><br>
Sunday- The other part of the PRESENT part. We had someone come to
church (that´s normal for regular missionaries, but hard for us). His
name is Andres. Davis and Christensen went to teach him on Tuesday,
but I couldnt go cause of office stuff. Anyways, he´s a stud. He is
super interested and understands everything. He is like 17, and 2 of
his friends gave us the reference. His friends even came to church
with him, even though they´re from different wards. He has a lot of
potential to progress. The ward gave him a good welcome as well, so
that´s good. We had a bunch of other appointments on Sunday, but they
all fell through. We even had 2 members with us, so it stinks that
everything fell through. We tried contacting in the park, but we only
found Lutheran ministers and weird Theologists. Sunday wasnt great,
but the week as a whole was.
<br><br>
So ya, there´s the week. I got to see the past (Barrio Jardin), see
the present improve (Andres and the Flia Villarroel), and I found out
about my future (leaving the office). I was very pleased with this
week, and this next one should be interesting cause it is cambios. We
should find out where Christensen is going and who is replacing me. I
love you all, and I will talk to you next week.<br>
Love,<br>
  Elder Bagley<br>
aka CEO of the mission (President called me the CEO in the letter this
week. Probably a typo of CFO, but whatever I´m the boss of the mission
now)</small></p>

                        <p>Today was ok I guess. We started out all normal in the morning. We had our district meeting and we actually went. It was pretty good. Me, Christensen, and Davis got to do the practice, which was fun. Saad and Crankshaw came and talked to our zone a little too. The afternoon was normal. Just hanging with the zone leaders and stuff. The most exciting part of the day was at night. I finished the financieros pretty quick, and then me, Davis, and Christensen went to the temple. Christensen's convert was going through for baptisms for the first time. In going there, Christensen and Davis were the witnesses for the baptisms. I didn't plan on doing anything, but then they asked me to record everything. I got to work the little camera and mark off all the baptisms. Nothing super special, but it was kind of a neat experience. The temple is always super calm and spiritual. It made me realize that we need to get the people to the temple, not just the chapel. Anyways, it was a good day, mostly cause of the temple.</p>

                        <p>Well, today wasn't very interesting. The day was spent like normal in the offices. We have Elder Emerson here for tramites right now as well. I didn't really have much to do; President has everything I need, but he gets back on Thursday. We got out of the offices at a decent time, but all the plans we had fell through. I feel like I need to fill up the page though. I'm just going to keep writing and hope some ideas come to mind. I really enjoy having my journal. It's kind of difficult to find time to write in it, but it's worth it. I love reading back on what happened last year and see how much I've changed. I'm basically at 100% so far, so I can't stop now.. I really have changed a lot on my mission. I'm interested to see if my family or other people notice when I get home. Anyways, in case it doesn't show in the journal, I love the mission. It's the best thing ever. I can't imagine it ending. It'll be hard to leave.</p>

                        <p>Weird day. The morning was pretty normal. The fun part was me, Davis, and Christensen trying to convince Hna Hansen that we needed to go to Chapare. We decided that we are going to take all the unused closets and use them to build a tree house. Maybe we'll convince her one day. We ended up leaving the office at like 2 because we were waiting for President to finish something. After that we went to the correo to send money to Tupiza. We finally got to lunch at 2:30ish. There's a reason why we should eat lunch at 1. I was super hungry. I spent some time in the office finishing President's finances and then making some crazy excel graphs/charts. They're useless, but it's kinda fun and I learn more about Excel. The night was pretty lame. We had a few ideas of what to do, but all of them fell through. Oh well, there's always tomorrow. I've also got my interview with President, so it should be a good day.</p>

                      <h3>October 24, 2014</h3>
                      <p>Today was good. In the morning we just studied normally. One fun thing was that when we read the Book of Mormon between the 3 of us, we would either read the words in spanish and then try to translate to english or from english to spanish. Surprisingly, we were able to translate pretty well. We also played 3 on 3 soccer in the morning, but me, Davis, and Christensen dominated pretty well. After lunch I had my interview with President Hansen. It was a good and interesting interview. This first thing he did was tell me that I'll be leaving the offices in December. WOOHOO! I was really scared I would stay longer. He asked me for suggestions on who could replace me as well. I gave him a couple that would be good. A lot of the interview was him just telling me I'm doing well. You can tell he respects me a lot. It's made me feel really good to be able to have his approval. He appreciates us a lot. He closed with a prayer in which he really talks with God. You could feel the spirit for sure. At night we just tried to contact some people, and we ended up teaching this guy named Roberto at his door. Finding out I'm leaving in December, it was a good day.</p>

                    <p>Today was a good day. The morning was just normal. We had to go to the offices for a little bit, but then we went to the little exposition. Because of the 50yr anniversary, the was a big exposition in the Plaza Colon. It was pretty cool, each ward had a booth where they displayed arts and crafts, and the missionaries set up 2 kiosks. The best part was being able to see Barrio Jardin. I got to talk to the Bishop for a while, a bunch of the members, and I even saw rosella. She's doing great and is still active. After that thing we ate lunch with Hna Claudia rivera. We had a lesson with the Flia Gallardo afterwards and it went pretty well. The best part of the day was what happened at night. We contacted a reference that Hna Urquidi gave us of a family. The parents weren't there, but we met the 3 kids. It's the Flia Villarroel and they're super cool. The could be great members. Anyways, a really solid day, hopefully tomorrow is as good.</p>

                    <p>Another pretty good day I guess. Church was good. We didn't have our less actives or the Flia Villarroel, but we did have an investigator at church. His name is Andres De La Torre. He is a reference from some members from other wards. Christensen and Davis went to teach him on Tuesday. I couldn't go through cause I had office stuff. This kid is great though. Really smart and really interested. He asks questions and he is just great. Church was decent enough. Consejo de Barrio wasn't completely terrible, like it usually is. We ate lunch with the Flia Antonio. It's a mom and her 2 daughters. The mom, she had some really incredible life stories. Her husband has been in the states for 14yrs and they haven't seen him in that time. The still talk and even do FHE on Skype every week. The rest of the day was pretty tough. A lot of appts fell through. We did teach a less active named Bridget. Later we had Samuel and Paola (some members) with us, but the appt fell through. We ended up just contacting in the park. We found some weird people. Overall, a decent day, especially with Andres.</p>

                    <p>Today was a decent p-day I guess. We just did regular morning stuff in the morning. We cleaned the house a little bit and stuff. After that, we went to the offices and did email. Nothing too special going on a home. Just regular. BYU Football keeps losing, so that kinda sucks. After that we went to the chapel to the zone activity. For the 3rd or 4th time, we played soccer and had a BBQ. It was ok I guess, but it's kinda boring to do the same thing. The BBQ was just normal, I didn't get much to eat. Soccer was pretty fun. I enjoy playing soccer, somehow it doesn't really get old. However, I took a shot and hit the side of the goal and the ball popped. Bummer... Especially cause it was Davis's ball. We ran home to get a new one, and then played a little more. We ended the day with the airport. There was a missionary going home for health reasons. We went to the offices for a bit, talked to the APs, then we went home. Just a regular day.</p>
