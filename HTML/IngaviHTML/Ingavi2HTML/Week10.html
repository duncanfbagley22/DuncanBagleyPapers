            <h1>Week 10 <small>(October 20, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>I am 16, going on 17</h3>
            <p><small>Dear family,<br>
    This was an interesting week. From a new companion, to a visit
from some important people, to visiting El Paso, it was good stuff. I
put the title as our favorite little Sound of Music song because
yesterday I hit 16 months. Earlier in my mission, I would always say
that I "almost have X amount of months". Now it´s the opposite, I
prefer to say I have 15 months up until the actual day that it
changes. Anways, I´ll start off the letter by explaining our current
companionship situation. Right now we are in a trio. Me, Elder
Christensen, and Elder Davis (he´s from Orem, like 9ish months in the
mission). Elder Christensen is training Elder Davis to be the next
secretary to the president. We´ll be together like this until sometime
during the first week in November, when Elder Christensen will go back
to the field. It used to be weird to have 2 gringos together, but 3 is
something all together new. It´s been really fun though. We speak a
lot of english, but our spanish is all pretty good, so it´s not like
we have problems. So now that you understand that, here´s what
happened this week...
<br><br>
Tuesday- A crazy day. I think I mentioned this last week, but my boss
visited this week. Not just him, but his boss, and that guys boss too.
They were some important people. 3 of them work in Lima, and one was
even white. The white guy is one of the more important financial
people in South America. No pressure... It all went well though. They
just talked about a few changes in the area and stuff like that.
Whenever they come I have to use my fancy spanish to seem smart. It
was cool because my boss, the guy from Santa Cruz, was basically just
telling all the other guys how good I am and stuff. It made me feel
good. We were there for like 2-3 hours though. I understand now why
Dad complains about meetings. These guys always make me realize that
my job is part of the real world. The rest of the day was pretty
normal, nothin special.
<br><br>
Wednesday- Just a normal day, I had the zone leader meetings on
Wednesday because there wasnt time on Tuesday.
<br><br>
Thursday- In the morning we had a service project cutting some leather
and stuff. There is a less active family that owns a leather glove
making business. I was incharge of cutting leather. Super fun... well
not really. We had a fun time though. At night we tried to contact a
reference, but they werent there, so we ended up just going to dinner
after trying to contact some other people at their doors.
<br><br>
Friday- Didnt really get out of the office. In the morning we had to
do tramites, so we had to stay in the office to make up for lost time.
I´ll be illegal soon, so it´s good that I´m doing the visa stuff.
<br><br>
Saturday- In the morning we just did some office stuff, like paying
for an MRI and paying for someone moving houses. The afternoon had
some interesting moments. We met a lady that was really into the
bible, so she just went on the attack. We didnt really fight, just
left a pamphlet and got on our way. We walked around trying to find
people, but no one was home. There´s a problem with the offices is
that the days where we can work in the field (saturday and sunday) are
the days that everyone is at the market and stuff like that. No one is
ever home. We taught a lesson to a less active guy, contacted some
people in the street, but that was about it.
<br><br>
Sunday- Church was normal. In the afternoon we went to eat lunch with
some less actives, but they kinda just left the food for us, so it was
basically like eating by ourselves. In the afternoon we taught one of
our investigators, Maria Eugenia. She´s the one that wants to stop
smoking. She has a really short attention span, but miraculously
remembers everything we teach. We set some plans to help her stop
smoking. We then went to a member baptism. The rest of the day
involved people falling through on lessons and stuff. I also got a
rock in my eye, which was really annoying. My eye was all red and
stuff and I couldnt focus on anything else. We tried everything, but
it wouldnt come out. However, I just decided to fall asleep and hope
it was gone the next morning, which is was.
<br><br>
Today- First we went up to the Cristo statue. It was funnish I guess,
but I´ve been enough times. Then we went out to El Paso to eat with
Benita, my old pensionista. Gosh I miss that place a lot. I had a good
time there. Benita also is like the best cook in the world, so that
made it better. I miss being on the outskirts of Cocha. It´s a lot
more peaceful out there. One day I will be a regular missionary again.
<br><br>
So that´s my week. Having Elder Davis here has made things fun. He´s
really laid back, but likes to work hard, which fits my style. We
should have a good time here. I love you all, and I´ll talk to you
next week.

                        <p>Today was a bit stressful. I got to the office around 9. At 9:30 I had a little meeting with some important people. Eddy Rocha (Fiannce guy for Bolivia), Francisco Fierro (Finance guy in Peru), Dario Vallejo (some finance due for the whole area) and David Adams (basically the most important finance guy in South America). No pressure, right? It wasn't that bad. I only had a meeting with Fierro and Rocha. They made me feel like I was doing a good job. Rocha just talked me up the whole time. I always leave those meetings feeling pretty smart, but I sweat a lot. I think them, and President, are pretty thankful to have me. The rest of the day was boringish. Elder Davis finally got here. He's a good kid, should be fun to be his comp. Him and Christensen went to Rodizio's grill, and tried to make me jealous. After the meetings with the area guys, I was deathly tired the rest of the day. It wasn't a super stressful day, but I'm glad it's over.</p>

                        <p>Back to the regular boringness. We just studied and stuff in the morning. It's a little weird to be in a trio. I haven't been in a trio since June. After studies we headed to the office. There wasn't much to do in the morning, so I just tried to clean up my office. In the afternoon, I had the meetings with the zone leaders. I keep talking with Elder Lopez about us going to Tupiza. I'm not gonna lie, I would really enjoy that. The rest of the day was pretty boring. I talked to Elder Berrett a little about life before the mission. I guess he went home for 2 weeks last November to be a witness in an important court case. Crazy stuff. We had 2 random hermanas in the office all day doing reference. Probably a better idea to not have them there. Overall it was a pretty regular day. At least we've got Davis here, to bring some change to the offices.</p>

                        <p>Today was a pretty fun day. We startd with a service project at around 8. We went to a less active family's house, had breakfast, and then worked with a bunch of leather. We had to sort the pieces, cut them, and then pile them up. Me and Christensen did that part, it was pretty boring. We had a fun time though, cause Davis took a little kitten and pretended to use it as a gun. It's been really fun with Davis here. Christensen is more relaxed and things just go better. After the service we just headed to the office. It was a pretty boring day in the office. The Alalay zone leaders went to the office, I went to the bank, and that was it. We got out and worked a little at night. First we tried to contact a reference, but he wasn't there. Then a less active, but she wasn't there. Finally another less active, who wasn't there, but we did talk to and set an appt with his nephew. Not a terrible day, having Davis is making things fun, and we're working harder.</p>

                      <p>Well, today started out very slowly. At 8 we got to the imigrations offices to do visa stuff. We left at 12... We were there for a good long while. It would've been terribly boring, except there was a good group of guys there (Toomer, Harwood, Long, Grover, etc) It took forever though, I started to get a little impatient. After it finally ended we just went to the office, and then to lunch. After lunch we went to IC Norte. I had to gather together a list of prices of a bunch of stuff. I'm not really sure what purpose it serve, but I did it nonetheless. The area guys asked for it. After that I just hung in the office. Some guy came by the office to finalize his stuff to become a mission vendor. Valerio and Coffing also visited the office, so I got to talk to them for a while. The only other things that happened were that we did some fun photoshopish things with a picture of Elder Davis, and we had the Relief Society President cancel lunch with us. Pretty sure she hates us. Anyways, tomorrow should be interesting.</p>

                    <h3>October 18, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Interesting day. In the morning we studied like usual. However, around 8:30, Calderon came in asking if one of us could go with E' Mendoza to a lesson, because Calderon was busy. Now, "busy" for Calderon can mean a whole lot of things, but I decided not to fight it, and I volunteered to go. Christensen got really mad for some reason. Anyways, I went with Mendoza to teach a 19yr old girl named Valerie. We were pretty rusty at teaching at first, but as we kept going you could tell we got back into the groove of teaching. It was a good lesson, and she understood well. It felt good to teach again. After that we did some office stuff (give the APs money, almost pay for an MRI). We weren't able to go to lunch with the member, so we went to Los Castores. The afternoon involved a lot of walking. We talked to a Bible-bashing lady, knocked on a bunch of doors, and went without success. We did contact a family that seemed cool. We visited the Flia Antonio where they gave us some references, and then we taught Santiago Torres. It wasn't a terrible day at least. Working with Davis has been fun.</p>

                    <p>Today was ehh, especially how it ended. Church was normal. We had to teach the Gospel Principles class, with 0 preparation (our fault, we were told). After church we went home to drop our suits off, and then to lunch. We were supposed to eat with the Flia Vasquez, but no one was there except for the 12yr old son. An older son came in later, and we talked to him. After that we went to teach MAria Eugenia. She has a short attention span, but she remembers the content well. She always gives us food too. After that we went to a ward baptism. There were a ton of people there, refreshments, and basically it looked like a baptism should. Finally, we talked to the bishop a little, went to dinner, and then home. Worst part of the day was that we were just walking when the wind blew something into my eye. I tried and tried to get it out, but I couldn't. I hurt a lot. I ended up just going to sleep, hoping it would magically disappear, which it did. Poor way to end the day.</p>

                    <p>P-day!!! The morning was actually pretty boring. We went up to the Cristo Statue with the zone. We rode in taxis this time, which made it way better than walking up. There wasn't much to do so we just took some pictures and left. We walked down afterwards. It's not a bad walk, but when you finish your legs are shaking. AFter that we went to the office, cause I had to give money to Elder Thurston for an MRI. After that we headed out to... El Paso. We met up with Elder Lopez and Elder Olson and we went to lunch at Benita's house. It was really good. She's like the best cook in the world. It was great to be back there again. I really miss it. After lunch, we walked through El Paso a little, Christensen got a haircut, and then we went back to the office. We wrote our families, and then we just hung around with Saad and Crankshaw. We went out at night to find a less-active, but they weren't there. It was also rainining. Anyways, it was a great day, just cause we went to El Paso.</p>
