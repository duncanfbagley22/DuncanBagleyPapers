            <h1>Week 8 <small>(October 6, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Weeping and Wailing and Gnashing of Teeth</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
    This week was a little bit less boring than the last one. We
actually did some fun things and worked a little bit. On top of a
somewhat exciting week, it was conference, which is basically better
than Christmas for a missionary. I´ll just go day by day with what
happened...
<br><br>
Tuesday- Just a regular day. All the zone leaders came in again. I
like tuesdays cause I dont stay by myself all day. Back in the good
ole days, aka Sucre, I realized that everything goes better in a
mission when you are talking to people and doing things. The office
doesnt really provide those opportunities. However, being in the offce
I´ve been able to meet basically everyone in the mission which is
cool. Anyways, tuesday was just normal.
<br><br>
Wednesday- We had the leadership conference meeting thingy. It really
doesnt have a big affect on us. We just have to serve lunch, give a
little presentation, and have 8-10 zone leaders in our house. The
presentation is pretty boring, serving all of my buddies isnt really
the funnest job, but having everyone at our house is fun. Also, Elder
Prado left to his area today, so we are back down to 4. Elder
Christensen´s replacement should get here next week or so. With Prado
leaving, we gave him a little surprise (there´s a video).
<br><br>
Thursday- One of the more eventful days. We got up at 6 and went with
6 of the zone leaders to go play "basketball". There´s a little
basketball court a few blocks from our house where the hoops are like
8ft tall. Needless to say, it was pretty fun. The day in the office
was pretty normal. We had to pay for something at a super nice
dentist´s office. It´s so nice that they had a massage chair. Around 5
we went to go help some lady in our ward move. As we showed up, she
was in a big discussion with her land lady and another lady there.
There was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth. I thought punchs
were gonna be thrown, so I was ready to get in there. Turns out, they
were fighting about paying a half month´s light costs. People these
days. Anyways, we helped move a bunch of boxes and stuff up some
stairs. It was good to help out, the lady needed us. We also had a
lesson with Margarita. We are working really hard on "patterns of
conversion" something Elder Waddell taught. Just trying to get people
used to things like reading and praying, because that´s how people
will become converted. She´s been reading pretty well, so things are
good.
<br><br>
Friday- We went to the airport (you can pretty much assume that that
happens every day). There was a new missionary coming in, so we picked
her up and went to the Cristo statue, like we did last week. We had a
little meeting in the mission home, where we got to eat lunch as well.
Literally, the mission home is like a 5 star restaurant as far as I´m
concerned. Sonia (from El Paso, my old pensionista´s niece) is a
really really good cook. In the afternoon we just stayed in the
office. There were a few people with obedience interviews, President
Hansen doesnt like disobedience at all. All is well though. Dont
worry, I´m still trying to be as obedient as I can be.
<br><br>
Saturday- Conference!!!! It was really good. We watched all 3 sessions
in our stake center with the North American missionaries in our stake.
We showed up late cause we had to go to the airport, but we only
missed one talk. We ate lunch with the members that live next door,
which was good as well. It´s cool being able to listen to people speak
in their native language, especially when I understand it. I plan on
watching all the talks given in spanish in spanish when I get home. I
also need to learn Portuguese and Cantonese (as mom (I think it was
mom) would say, it´s just a made up language). I really enjoyed Elder
Christofferson and Elder Klingñakjegbatataaa´s (The guy who was
Mission President in Ukraine, his name was weird so I dont remember)
talks. My overall favorite was Pres Uchtdorf in Priesthood session
about "Lord, is it I". Lots of things to think about. A great day
<br><br>
Sunday- More conference. Since people in Bolivia only ever show up to
the sunday morning session (there´s a difference of hundreds of people
between that session and any other one), they werent showing it in
english. Because of that, me, Christensen, and Elder Cardona (dont let
the name fool you, he´s a gringo) from our zone went to the offices
for the first session. For the second session, we just had to watch it
in spanish. I understand it all, but I get more out of it in English.
At night we taught Santiago, this less active guy. We are slowly
making progress with him, but he´s tough. He knows he needs to change
and wants to, but is very unsure about everything.
<br><br>
Monday- We just played beach volleyball with our zone and another
zone. It was pretty fun, I´m always diving all over the place and I
always end up with sand in my hair, in my pockets, and just
everywhere. Other than that, we just went to the supermarket (they
exist in Bolivia) and bought some stuff. A pretty low key day.
<br><br>
So there´s my week. This upcoming week shouldnt be too exciting,
especially because on Sunday we dont have church and cant leave
because of the national elections. I liked hearing about how Seth
chose the farthest away place from the office to go. If President asks
me, I´m gonna do the same thing. Since I am in the office, Matt was in
the office I think, and Seth was AP, sounds like Griff will be headed
there too. I love you all, I hope you enjoyed conference, and I´ll
talk to you next week.

Love,
  Elder Bagley</small></p>

                        <p>Long day. Usually we have district meeting and stuff, but we are having it on Friday this week. Because of that, we were in the office ALL DAY. The morning was good enough, we actually were able to study which is always good. After lunch we went back to the office, where I basically stayed in my desk for 6 hours. The ZLs from outside Cocha were there too, so I helped them with financial stuff. Probably the best part of the day was when we had a "secret" meeting with Pres Hansen. Actually, he just gave us rasberry (I'm 100% sure that's now how to spell that) cheesecake. It was really good, best secret meeting ever. Other than that, really the day was pretty boring. At night we ate dinner with Hna Brindley and Hna Ninataype who were visiting our pension. All the ZLs are staying at our house, but it's better this time than usual. It's E Weekes, Rhoton, Kenney, Meadows, Atwood, Grigor, Ruiz, and Cobarruvias, a pretty solid group. Not much else to say, tomorrow should be more exciting.</p>

                        <p>Wow, it's already October. Time goes by really fast. Today was good enough I guess. We had to take breakfast over to the leadership conference. Calderon bought this lame orange cream roll thing, so breakfast wasn't as satisfying. After that we went to the office. We had a nice little surprise for Prado. It was his last day, so what happened was that we pranked him a little. Christensen hid while I distracted Prado, then he came behind Prado and dumped a bucket of paper shreds on Prado. It was pretty funny, I think Prado liked it too. After that we went to the conference again to set up lunch and give our little presentations. Mine went good enough; Calderon and Prado are hard to watch. They take forever and even when Pres Hansen tells them to stop, they keep going. The rest of the day was just normal. I like the leadership conference, but I don't at the same time. I don't care about titles or anything, but it kinda sucks to basically be a servant to all the Zone Leaders. It sucks to have to work when everyone else is on vacation. Oh well, one day I'll leave the offices.</p>

                        <p>Today started out great. Me, Christensen, Weekes, Rhoton, Grigor, Kenney, Meadows, and Atwood got up early to go play basketball. Not just any basketball, but dunkball. There is a little court with like 8ft hoops. We were just dunking it and all that. It was super fun, we'll be playing again in 6 weeks. After that we dropped all the zone leaders off at the airport and then went to the office. The office was pretty normal, nothing special. At 5ish we went to go help a lady in our ward move houses. We also got to hear a big screaming fight between a land lady and a person living there about light. Super exciting. We helped move a bunch of boxes and stuff. When we got to the new house, we had to take everything up a flight of stairs. Not super hard, but a little tiring. After that we went to a lesson with Margarita Chacon. We are getting her to start reading consistently now and that's good. She's progressing, it's just really slow. She said she'll go to conference though, so that's also good. Not the most exciting day, but at least we did something.</p>

                      <p>Today was another good day, just cause it was different from usual. We started the day at the airport. There was a new missionary that finally got here. We picked her up, and then us 4, the APs, the Hansens, and 4 of the new missionaries and their trainers went up to the Cristo. After that we went down to the mission home, where we had a little training meeting and ate lunch. I love eating lunch in the mission home, cause everything is like gourmet food. After the misison home we just went to the offices. It was interesting today because there was about 3 interviews that happened, all about obedience. Pres Hansen is starting to crack down on the mission. I think that it's good, people will hopefully start to get a little bit better. I just surprised with the things people think they can get away with. We left the office super late cause Christensen had to make a flight for someone going home. There's been a good 10-15 people go home in the last few months. Anyways, conference starts tomorrow, so I'm pretty darn excited for that.<br><br><br></p>

                    <p>Woohoo!!! Conference!!! Actually, the day started and ended somewhat stressfully, but everything in the middle was good. We had to take Elder Tia to the airport to send him back to Sucre first. Then we went home to study. After regular study we had to go back to the airport. Elder Velarde went home. I'm not exactly sure why either. He's got some mental problems and I assume that is part of it. Anyways, we dropped him off and then we ran to conference. We missed the first speaker, but we got to the rest. We watched all 3 sessions in english. In between the 1st and 2nd sessions we had lunch with the Flia Robles. They live behind us, but I'd never really gotten to know them, so having lunch with them was good. All of conference was good. Pres Uchtdorf probably gave my favorite talk. Other than that, we just had 2 weird things happen. 1st, we couldn't find out if E' Velarde had gotten to Peru or not (he ended up staying in La Paz for a night, we thought he was lost) and we burned used garments we found in the house. Fun stuff. Conference round 2 tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>Yay, more conference! Today was a little bit more difficult though. The morning was just normal, we just studied and stuff. When we got to the stake center, we found out that they weren't going to show it in english. We went back and forth about whether we'd stay or go somewhere else to watch it in english. We finally decided to watch it in english in the office, so me, Christensen, and Elder Cardona went there to watch it. After that we went to lunch with the Flia Condori. They're cool, and they have a little kid that's really crazy. After lunch we went back to the stake center. We ended up watching the last session in Spanish. Watching in spanish is a bit harder, I understand but I don't get as much. One cool part was that when Elder Scott gave his talk, he also does the spanish version as a voiceover. It was cool to hear him speak spanish. The only other thing was that we had a lesson with Santiago. He's still hard, but I could feel the Spirit, so something could happen. Tomorrow's a much needed p-day.</p>

                    <p>Woo, p-day! Today was good enough I guess. After studying and all that we went to go play sand volleyball. It was our first activity as a zone this cambio, and it didn't go too bad. It was actually pretty fun. The Villa Graciela zone was there as well. I've grown to really like volleyball on my mission, so it is always fun to play. Our zone isn't too bad, better than I expected. After that, we went to the offices to do email. Me and Christensen went to Wist'upiku for lunch. It's probably the best Bolivian restaurant. We then went to Hipermaxi, the super marker. First thing's first, Christensen shops like a woman. We saw like 12 missionaries there, so it was like another activity. To end the day we just went back to the office to finish up email and to do some work. Usually I get so much work that I start before 6 and just keep going till dinner. P-days are very different in the offices, but they're still the best day of the week.</p>
