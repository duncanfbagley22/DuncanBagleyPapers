            <h1>Week 7 <small>(September 29, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>I´m starting to run out of creative title ideas</h3>
            <p><small>Dear family,<br>
   This was quite the busy week. Being a cambios week, we always have
a lot of stuff to do. We got home every night just dead tired. 2 or 3
times I just fell asleep writing in my journal. I do like cambios week
though, because it is different than regular weeks and not so boring.
It´s crazy to think that Griff is in the field now, doing the same
thing I do (well, before I was a secretary, but it´s still pretty
close I guess). Anyways, this is what happened this week...
<br><br>
Monday- We had a white elephant in the zone. I dont wanna brag, but it
was my idea. It was super fun, turned out better than expected. My
gift was a signed picture of me, Elder Weekes, and Elder Saad, a
weird, poorly translated english picture frame, and some cookies. I
ended up with a little Dora the Explorer doll. It was a great
activity. I´m gonna miss this zone a lot, a lot of people are
changing.
<br><br>
Tuesday- We got to the airport early to pick up the new missionaries.
There were a bunch that got here from Mexico, and a few even
remembered Griffin. We took them to the hotel and to eat and stuff.
It´s always fun to meet the new guys, they are just so energic and
excited to work. I got to talk with some of my friends from around the
mission too, who were there training this transfer. Later that day we
went to the airport to send the old missionaries home. First person
I´ve ever seen go to Utah, so seeing his schedule and realizing
that´ll be what we do soon is weird. At night we just ate pizza with
the new guys and went home. We´ve got 5 people in the house now. Elder
Mendoza is getting trained by Elder Prado. He is from Ecuador and is a
pretty cool guy, he speaks english pretty well. Also, Elder Weekes is
leaving from being AP. His replacement is Elder Crankshaw, one of my
good buddies in the mission. We´ll still have a good time in the
office.
<br><br>
Wednesday- We got up early and went to the Cristo statue with all the
new guys. On the way up I talked with Elder Jacobson (plays football
for Texas Tech, McKay Jacobson´s little brother). He is in Churuquella
right now, so it was good to hear how everyone is doing. We had the
training meeting later that day, as well as lunch in the mission home.
I also bought some nice spanish scriptures, something I´ve wanted to
do for a while.
<br><br>
Thursday- Just a normal day. Due to the fact that we were out of the
office for 2 days this week, I have to do 4 days of work in 2. I was
working super hard though, so it turned out all right.
<br><br>
Friday- Basically the same as Thursday, except that in the morning we
went to the mission home for a little training for missionaries that
came in on Friday. We ate pancakes, bacon, and scrambled eggs, and it
was spectacularly delicious.
<br><br>
Saturday- We got out and worked for a bit, first time in 2 weeks. We
got in contact with a less active we´ve been looking for, taught this
lady named Margarita, and taught another less active. Not anything
great, but something at least. We also went out to lunch with the
office staff, the APs, and the Hansens. It was really fun. I got to
eat cheesecake!!! It was really good. The Hansens are super cool,
especially in a relaxed setting. I did get sick on Saturday though,
waking up in the middle of the night because my throat hurt. It´s just
a cold, and I´m getting over it.
<br><br>
Sunday- Kind of a boring day. The only really exciting part was that
we were just walking down the street when this lady stopped us. She
asked if we knew any way to help her boyfriend stop drinking.
Obviously, we took down her info and set an appointment for this
morning. We went, but they werent there. I´m sure we´ll meet back up
with them though, she needs the gospel.
<br><br>
Monday- We were going to play volleyball, but it fell through. We
ended up just going to TGI Fridays with a bunch of our friends. It was
good enough. I also got a haircut. Tonight we have an FHE with a less
active, so that should be good.
<br><br>
I love you guys so much. Thanks for everything and I´ll talk to you next week.<br>
Elder Bagley

                        <p>Woohoo, transfers!!! It's a really busy week, but it's fun because it's a change to the routine. We got to the airport at like 8 to start with all the madness. 7 missionaries got here in the morning. They are all from the USA, and a few met my brother in the CCM in Mexico. They seem good and exciting. Me, Calderon, and Elder Mendoza took them to the hotel, to take pictures, and then to the mission home. I liked hanging out at the mission home, cause I got to talk to Sonia from El Paso and H Hansen, who's just really funny. There's a missionary, E Eagar, who doesn't seem very excited to be here, so Pres told me to look out for him. We ate lunch with everyone in Luigi's. I had a good time with E Jacobson, Roth, and Nielsen. In the afternoon we were in the office for a tiny bit, and then we went to the airport. We had to send some people home. I'm gonna miss them, like E Phillips and Alexander. We waited around for a while, until another new missionary showed up. I got to see Jorge from Jardin which was cool. The new missionary showed up, and then we went to the hotel to eat pizza. I just hung with Roth, Jacobson, and Crankshaw (new AP). Roth is probably one of the funniest people I've ever met. Today was a quick, busy day. Tomorrow should be the same.</p>

                        <p>Woohoo, more transfers!!! Early. today we went to the Cristo statue with all the new missionaries and their trainers. I sat by Elder Jacobson on the bus, and we just talked about Churuquella. I miss that place a lot. Up at the Cristo was fun, just hanging around with all those guys. After that we went down to the temple while the trainers had a meeting. I finally bought some nice scriptures, somthing I've been meaning to do for a while. Me and Christensen headed to the office for a bit, and then we went to the mission home for lunch. We ate there and then headed down to the temple to do the big training. I gave a little presentation (super boring) and then we just went to the office. There's a bunch of gringos training gringos, so it's not even a big deal anymore. From the offices we headed to the hotel for dinner. On the way there we literally got blindsided in our taxi by a person. They literally "ran" into the side of our taxi. Eating dinner was fun. Just hanging with Jacobson, Roth, and this time Elder Toomer stopped by. I haven't seen him since last July, so it's good to talk to him again. Another quick and busy day. This week always makes me tired though.</p>

                        <p>Back to the airport. We went there to drop off all of the people going outside of Cocha. I'm gonna miss those guys, they made this week really fun. After that we went home to study a little. Elder Mendoza is whipping the other 2 into shape. They're studying and all that. It'll be interesting to see how long it lasts. We went to the office after studying. It's gonna be a long week because I have to do my regular work that I do in 4 days in 2 days now. We finally went to lunch at the pension. Both of the new hermanas are very quiet. They're not bad, just not super exciting. I'm gonna miss Rumualdo and Hansen a lot. After lunch I had my little zone leader meetings. It's weird seeing the zone leaders in different areas now. The worst was having Laidlaw there in a different zone now and then Severiano coming in with a new companion. I trust in the cambios always being the right decision, but I miss the old zone. This last cambio was the best zone I've ever seen. I'm sure I'll get accustomed to the new people, but for now I'm just missing the old zone.</p>

                      <h3>September 26, 2014</h3>
                      <p>Today started out well. In the morning we went to the airport to pick up 3 new missionaries that came from Provo. These guys seem a lot older than the other ones from this week. We took them to the mission home and had breakfast. Pancakes, scrambled eggs, and bacon, it was incredibly delicious. I miss bacon. After that we had a little training meeting where we made little short presentations. We swung by the offices afterwards to do a few things, and then we went to lunch. After lunch, we headed to the bank, and then back to the offices. Due to this whole 4 days of work in 2 days, I've been going hard. I've wasted little time and at the end of the day I look back and realize I've done a lot of things. It's a good feeling. I think Christensen was in a bad moo, so I just avoided him. Pretty effective actually. I've learned that the best way to deal with him when he's mad is just not say anything. The only other things I can remember is just talking to Saad and Crankshaw a little and having some lady from the offices in Santa Cruz keep calling me for a bunch of things. Tomorrow's Saturday, should be an interesting day.<br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <h3>September 27, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Well flip, I'm sick. I woke up in the middle night cause I couldn't breath and my throat was on fire. I had to take ibuprofen to get back to sleep. The morning was normal, I just felt like dying. We left at 11 to go work. We were able to contact a less active, Anais Sanchez, and we had a productive lesson. For lunch we went to Churrasqueria Tunari, with all the scretaries and the assistants and the Hansens. We all got there on time, except for Prado, Mendoza, and Calderon who showed up a half hour late, takes guts to show up late to lunch with the President. Lunch was fun. President was in a really good mood, so that made lunch better. I also got cheesecake, which always makes me happy. After lunch we went out to work. We taught Margarita Chacon, and it went pretty well. I was having a hard time though, just cause I was sick. After that we walked like 3km to contact a reference. On the way back I was struggling just cause my energy was gone. We ended the day with Santiago Torres. He's difficult, just cause he knows and wants to change, but won't do it. It pretty frustrating. Tomorrow's Sunday, so it should be good. Hopefully I'm feeling better.</p>

                    <p>I'm still sick, but I'm getting better. Church was normal, boring consejo de barrio, elders quorum president is weird, just the usual. Really, consejo is just super boring. After that we went to lunch at Nacho's house. They're just a super cool family. Hna Claudia (the mom) basically is like a mom for us, especially with me being sick. We ate BBQ and stuff, it was really good. After that we went to the office to get money, and then to the airport. I had to reimburse the Tupiza District president. After that we went to our ward mission meeting. The ward missionaries actually showed up, which was rare. After that we went to a lesson that fell through. On our way back from the lesson, this random lady came up to us and asked if we could help her boyfriend stop drinking. We set up an appointment for tomorrow morning. I love when people contact us, it's great. We finished off the night teaching the Flia Castro. They'd be great members, but they've just never gotten in a rhythm. We've set ourselves up well for this next week, hopefully it goes well.</p>

                    <p>Well, I'm still sick, but I'm improving. Today was ehh... We had a planned lesson at 9, but it fell through. After that we went to office. Like always, I ended up having to do a bunch of work. People must think I don't have p-day. We were planning on playing beach volleyball, but that fell through too. We ended up going to lunch at Fridays. We went with Valerio, Stoker, Toomer, Vega, and a bunch of other guys. It was pretty fun. Our ZLs were there too... That used to be a good thing. However, E' Potts is no E' Laidlaw. It's just not the same anymore. The zone isn't the same as it used to be. After Fridays we went to get my haircut, and then to the offices. I wrote my family and all that. Griffin is in the field now, which is cool, a little weird, but cool. He sounds good. To finish the nigh, we had an FHE with the Flia Sanchez. The gameplan was to have the less active daughter and non member son-in-law there, but they weren't. We talked about prophets though, and it was a good FHE nonetheless. Another busy week, should be fun.</p>
