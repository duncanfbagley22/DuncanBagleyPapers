            <h1>Week 9 <small>(October 13, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Home Sweet Home</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
    Well, this was an interesting week. Not really sure why it was
interesting, but I feel like it was different than other weeks. First
things first, I´m getting a new companion tomorrow. I´ll still be with
Elder Christensen, but his replacement is coming in tomorrow to start
the training. We are going to be in a trio for 3 weeks. His name is
Elder Davis. He has like 9ish months or something in the mission. I
think he is from Orem or somewhere like that. I´ve met him before,
he´s a solid guy, it should be fun to be with him. It´ll be good to
get some change for once. He´ll get here tomorrow morning. That´s
probably the biggest news, but I´ll go through the rest of the days.
<br><br>
Tuesday- We finally went to a district meeting. We hadnt been able to
go to one for the last couple weeks just because of office stuff and
whatnot. It was good to go. Elder Mendoza (from Ecuador/Chile/Spain)
is a good district leader, really interested in helping us as
missionaries. I get along really well with him. After the district
meeting we just went to the offices and had a regular tuesday.
<br><br>
Wednesday- Nothing too special, just hanging in the offices
<br><br>
Thursday- In the morning we got up and played soccer. We have 2 guys
staying with us for tramites. Elder Larsen from Layton, and Elder
Shakespear from St George. I know everyone probably is wondering, yes
Elder Shakespear is a direct decendent of William Shakespeare. The
whole day we just stayed around the office. There´s been interviews
this whole week, so the Hansens have been in the office. Hna Hansen
likes to joke around with us and make fun of me. She´s probably the
funniest mission president´s wife ever. That night we went out to go
visit some members, looking for some references. We didnt really get
anything though
<br><br>
Friday- Basically the same thing as Thursday. As we left the office,
it was raining super hard, so we went back to the house to get
raingear. It gave me an excuse to use my warm coat and my hat. We
visited Hna Urquidi, who seemed really happy to see us. She is a good
active member. She hurried us in and had us give her mom a blessing.
We gave the blessing (I doubt I can give a blessing in english now)
and then had a little lesson. She gave us a reference, so mission
accomplished
<br><br>
Saturday- It started out super fun. We got up at 4 in the morning to
go to the bus terminal. There is a sister from Sucre that registered
to vote in Cocha, so she needed to be here to vote. It´s an obligation
to vote here, and you have to do it in the same place where you
registered. That caused a few problems for us, but it was all ok. I
didnt like waking up at 4 though. We worked all day though. After
lunch we had a lesson with that lady I mentioned a few weeks ago that
wants to stop smoking. She has a really short attention span, but when
she pays attention she´s good. She really likes us, she even
remembered my name. We went looking for people for a good few hours,
but no one was there. We had a member kid with us, so it was kinda
lame to not find anybody. We met with this family of members, but they
only had references for other areas.
<br><br>
Sunday- We did nothing. Since it was election day, meetings of 8 or
more people were prohibited. Preaching the gospel was too. Because of
that, we just stayed home. The day passed by pretty quickly, probably
cause I slept the whole day basically. We just went to lunch, that was
our only outside time. By no surprise, Evo Morales will be president
again. Usually, presidents can only be president for 2, 5 year terms.
However, he changed the constitution, so he go reelected for a 3rd
term yesterday. I dont really know if he is good or not, but a lot of
people dont like him. He is kind of a joke around Cocha. He doesnt
really like gringos, that´s why there are some anti american people
around here.
<br><br>
Monday- We went to play capture the flag, but everyone showed up late,
so we left before we even played. However, we did play around with
some foam gun type things. We also went to Elder Christensen´s old
area for lunch. It is the richest area in the mission, so I felt
weird. It´s different than El Paso was. The pensionista´s family was
super cool, so it was fun.
<br><br>
So, there´s my week. Here´s my deep though of the week. I was talking
to one of my buddies here yesterday just about life. I never realized,
but his life was super hard before the mission. Tons of family
problems and all that, to a point where he had nowhere to live for a
few weeks. He really emphasized how important his friends on the
mission are, just to help him with everything. It made me realized how
important we can be to other people, how big of an influence our
examples can have. I realized that there are a few people I know that
I really look up to, just because they act like they should and help
everyone else. It is something I want to work on, just to be an
example to everyone. We dont realize that everyone is watching us, and
whatever we do has an influence. I thought a lot about it last night.
Deep right? Anyways, tomorrow I have some very important people coming
to the office. My boss´s boss is coming from Lima. This is the line of
authority: Me->Eddy Rocha->this guy coming tomorrow->some other
guy->some dude in Utah->The presiding bishopric. The people arent
really coming for me, but they are going to pass by, should be fun...
I love you all, and I hope you have a great week.
<br><br>
Elder Bagley
<br><br>
p.s (you dont need to include this when you send this letter out to
everyone else, but it should make you proud parents) Not to toot my
own horn, but this is President Hansen´s letter to me this week:
 "You are one of the most important and trusted missionaries in this
entire mission. I appreciate so very much your dedication, patience,
and thoroughness in doing this work".</small></p>

                        <p>Well, I thought we weren't going to have to go to the airport today, but we did. We sent an Elder to Sucre, but he lost his ID, so we had to take him his passport. After that we finally went to our first district meeting of the cambio. Elder Mendoza is a pretty good district leader, it's the first time I've ever had a district leader who's younger than me. The zone meeting was different. For the most part, the zone is ok. The only really noticeable difference is that the Hermanas from Chimba (Paiva and Cuadra) are annoying. I said something about p-day and they are just negative. The zone is gonna be tough with them there. After lunch was just a normal tuesday. It's weird cause Tuesday is like my favorite/least favorite day of the week. I love talking to everyone that comes in, but I get really bored doing the same thing over and over again. I'm getting really good at typing on the big calculator though, so that's "cool". Anyways, this week won't be too exciting, but hopefully I get through it.</p>

                        <p>Today was pretty boring. We've got 3 guys here with us that are doing tramites. Elder Ortiz from Guatemala, Elder Larsen from Layton, and Elder Shakespear. Yup, Shakespear, direct decendent of William Shakespeare. That's pretty cool I guess. I've made a lot of references. We are thinking that he could possibly replace Christensen. That'd be pretty cool to be comps with a Shakespear. The actual day was boring like I said. There's interviews going on in the office, so at least there's some people coming through that I can talk to. I'm still getting over my cold that I've had for a week or 2. Hermana Hansen has been bugging me about it. She's really fun to have around. The rest of the day was just me doing office stuff. I got the financial report for the mission. It got ruined by tramites secretaries that made orders without the financial secretary knowing. I'm not really sure what to do about it. Christensen was kinda in a bad mood, which makes the day worse. Oh well, tomorrow should be better.</p>

                        <p>Today was a little bit more exciting. We started out playing futsal this morning. It's not as fun as it used to be. Mendoza is less annoying that Prado, but isn't as good. Worthy doesn't really like to play, so she's not as fun as Rumualdo. We also had Larsen and Shakespear. Larsen is ok, Shakespear isn't really a sports guy. Probably won't play as much futsal anymore. The day in the office was pretty boring. The Quillacollo zone was there for interviews, so I was able to see E' Long, Harwood, and my friends from that zone. Hermana Hansen likes to make fun of me... but it's ok, it makes things fun. Me and Christensen talked to Hna Hill. It's kinda weird, cause she's from our group, but she goes home in like 2 months. At night we went over to Nacho's house. We are planning on talking to a bunch of members to try and find some less actives that they know. Hna Claudia (Nacho's wife) didn't really know anyone, but I think we'll eventually find someone. We're trying at least.</p>

                      <p>Today was pretty similar to yesterday, just with different people. In the morning we went to the airport to send E' Larsen back to Sucre. After that we just went to the office. The Jaihuayco zone had their interviews. That zone is infamous for being very disobedient. It shows, especially when 2 missionaries don't even where their suits to their interviews. I did get to see E' Pinta and E' Edmonds though. After doing regular stuff in the office, we headed out to work. It was raining pretty hard, so we passed by the house to get our coats and stuff, and then we went to Hna Urquidi's house. I guess we showed up at the right time, cause she seemed really happy to see us and immediately had us give a blessing to her mom. After that we gave a small lesson. Hna Urquidi teaches the gospel principles class, and is very helpful. She has a sister (probably has mental problems) who was flirting with Christensen. We didn't get any numbers, but at least we helped someone who needed us.<br><br></p>

                    <p>Today started out terribly terrible. We had to get up at 4am to go to the terminal to pick up Hna Torrico. She needed to be in Cocha to vote or something. After that terrible start, I just went back to sleep until 8, when we went to the airport to send the tramites guys back. The rest of the morning we just studied and all that. We ate lunch at Esperanza Sanchez's pension. The food is very Bolivian (ie rice, potatoes, weird meat). I got through it though. After that we had a lesson with Maria Eugenia. She's got a short attention span. There were some good parts in the lesson though. After that we visited Natividad and Maria Pantoja. They're off and on active. Maria is really negative. We got them excited for missionary work though. After that we had Camilo (a YM) with us. All of our ideas fell through, so we ended up just visiting the Flia Cortez. They're a really cool family, but they didn't have any references. Not a super productive day, but at least we left the office all day.</p>

                    <h3>October 12, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Today. Was. Boring. Today we couldn't leave the house, due to election laws and stuff. We also couldn't have church. So, instead of a regular Sunday, we stayed home. We studied and stuff in the morning. After that I kinda just fell asleep until lunch. We had lunch with the Flia Flores. I'd heard they thought that I was boring and mad all the time. My goal was to change their perception, and I think I did. We joked around about how my small cut on my finger would keep me from working and stuff. It was fun. After that we got home, I washed some dishes, and then I fell asleep. That's basically how I spent my day. We played with balloons and stuff in the pension. At night, I had a good talk with Elder Valerio. I learned a lot of stuff about him that I didn't know before. He's had a hard life. He's got 0 family support. His story made me think a lot about life. Also made me think how much influence we have on people. I pondered a lot today, but it's not like I had anything else to do.</p>

                    <p>Today wasn't super exciting, but at least we left the house. The morning was just studying and stuff. After that we cleaned the house a little. We passed by the office to make a flight for Elder Davis (Christensen's replacement, he gets here tomorrow), and then we went to the park. We were supposed to have a zone activity, but everyone showed up late. We ended up just playing around espuma. It's like a little foam spray thing. I got drenched by Elder Stoker. Even though it wasn't really a planned activity, it turned out ok. For lunch we went to Villa Moscu to eat with Christsen's old pensionista. It was good for him to go. After going by the terminal and the hotel for business matters, we just stayed at the office to do email. Sounds like Griff is doing really well on his mission. Anyways, a decent enough day, tomorrow is gonna be a bit stressful.</p>
