            <h1>Week 12 <small>(November 3, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Just a Bunch of Stuff</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
      How goes everything? I hope Halloween was good for everyone.
It´s not really a big deal here. Everyone just celebrates "Todos
Santos" and weird things like that. It´s a weird Catholic twist on
trick-or-treating. They go around and knock on doors. They don´t dress
up though I don´t think. Then they have to say a prayer "Padre Nuestro
or Ave Maria" mostly. Then after they have prayed, the people give
them little cookies or drinks of soda and stuff like that. It´s like
prayer-or-treating. There werent a lot of people home this weekend
because of the holiday. Plus we have transfers on Tuesday, but there
are 0 flights from half the missionaries, so that just threw a wrench
in our plans yesterday. We spent a good chunk of time trying to solve
the problem. With us 3 working on it, we figured it all out
eventually. As I said, this is cambios week, which is actually
important for me this time. Day by day stuff wasnt very interesting,
but there were some good things this week, so I will just explain the
important stuff.
<br><br>
Cambios- They went exactly as I thought they would. I am staying for 6
more weeks, then leaving to...an undetermined destination. My
replacement is Elder Vega, from Chile. I recommended him to President
Hansen. He´s a super cool kid. He was in my zone for 2 cambios, so I
know him pretty well. He was like a math champion in Chile or
something, so he´ll be fine. Elder Christensen is going to Sucre, my
old zone. Elder Calderon is leaving and Elder Hansen, a kid from
Washington, is coming here. One of the APs is leaving too. I´m really
excited for this cambio. It´s going to be really fun in the offices.
<br><br>
P-Day- Today we had a fun activity. We had the idea to play flag
football earlier this week, so that´s what we did. We had like 18 guys
and we played with socks and garbage bags instead of flags. We rented
out a turf field and played for like and hour and a half. There arent
really many footballs in Bolivia, but there is a white guy that lives
here that is from Orem, so we just borrowed his. It was super fun, one
of our better ideas.
<br><br>
Churuquella- So, Saturday morning we went to the temple. We had to
drop off some missionaries to go to a session there before they go
home. A missionary came up to me and told me some hermana was looking
for me. I got up to the steps to see 2 hermanas from Churuquella. I
found out that the whole ward was basically there. Naturally I asked
if Hna Vicky (the pensionista) was there, but she wasnt. I found out
that the Flia Aguirre (Oliver´s family) was there. We didnt have time
to stay there, but I called Hno Fredy (the dad) and arranged to meet
up with them later. I saw them that night at the bus terminal. They
said that they were staying until Sunday night and asked where a
chapel was to go to church. I invited them to ours, and they came.
They are like the best family ever. I miss them so much. I guess they
ask why I never call and stuff. I have to visit there before I go
home. Yes, there are pictures.
<br><br>
Temple- On Thursday we got to go to the temple. The temple is just the
greatest place on earth. We saw a new presentation. It´s interesting
to see the difference in each one. We took a bunch of pictures and it
was an enjoyable day.
<br><br>
Halloween- Me, Elder Davis, and Elder Christensen aka gringo trio aka
the 3 nephites, had dinner at Gringo Burger. It´s a guy from Oklahoma
that´s in Barrio Cobija that makes burgers and stuff. We ate there (we
also had Root Beer for the first time in my mission) and took pictures
with the masks and stuff.
<br><br>
Mission Home- We went to the mission home to see the cambios and we
got to eat milk and cookies with the Hansens. Fun stuff
<br><br>
Andres- Geez, this kid deserves a whole email. On Tuesday Davis and
Christensen went to teach him, and when they got back to the office
they just popped there heads into my office and said "best lesson
ever". On Sunday we got to church and didnt see him there, so we were
a little disappointed. He showed up like 5 minutes late though, so all
is well. It was raining pretty hard, but he still came. We taught him
after all the meetings. He is like the best investigator ever. He
understands everything perfectly, gets really excited about the
principles, answers questions during church, and already has a
testimony. We taught him the Plan of Salvation and he loved it. At one
point, I was explaining the whole spirit prison thing and how the
people that didnt get a chance to hear the gospel receive it there and
he just exclaimed "man, this plan is perfect!". He also explained to
us how he wasnt going to go to church just cause it was early and
raining and he didnt have any clean clothes, but then he realized that
sometimes we have trials in life and we need to overcome them. He put
on whatever clothes he could find (in his words, he looked like a
clown) and showed up. He told us "where there´s a ´but...´ there´s a
way". We have another lesson with him on Thursday in the stake center.
We would teach him at 2, but he goes to Institute, so we´re doing it
later. This kid is amazing. A one point in the lesson I just looked
over at Elder Christensen and chuckled a little, just cause he
understands so well. From the Fall of Adam and Eve to the Celestial
Kingdom to Baptism... He gets everything. I dont even feel like I
teach that well, he just grasps it all so fast that it doesnt matter.
He´s gonna be a stud of a member. Watch out for him becoming a 70 of
something.
<br><br>
So there´s the important things of the week. It was hard to think of a
title, just cause there was a bunch of stuff that happened that was
important. This week we´ll be picking up new missionaries and doing
all that. Should be a good one. Love you guys, have a good week. Go

                        <p>I don't really have much to say about today. I feel like Tuesdays are usually just my most boring day. The morning was goodish I guess. We had district meeting that was good. There was a practice that I was a part of. I used to never volunteer, but I kind of like it now. I got to be the investigator, which is always fun. I like putting myself in the investigators shoes. The afternoon was just normal. Just doing zone leader meetings. The most interesting was at night. Elder Potts was in the office and we just had a whole long big talk about life and jobs and stuff. He's a really smart kid, he just hasn't always made good decision. I used to rag on him a lot, but he's a good guy. Anyways it was a pretty boring day. Hopefully this will be a good week though.</p>

                        <p>No tenía mucho que escribir para hoy, entonces decidí escribir en español. Creo que mi español no ha mejorado tanto como mejoró antes. Estando con 2 gringos por 3 semanas no ayuda mucho. Fuimos a la oficina como normal hoy. Nada para reportar. No voy a tomar toda la pagina, pero quiero añadir algo importante. Eso es que he aprendido que la cosa mas importante en la obra y la vida es el amor. No pasa nada sin el amor. Hay que amar a todos, no importa. Gosh, done with that. I'm so tired. Half the things I've written make no sense. Anyways, boring, hopefully tomorrow is good. <- Not sure what I wrote.</p>

                        <p>Today started off well. In the morning we got to go to the temple. It's always great to go there. We got there at about 6 and got into the first session. It was a new presentation which was cool. It's cool how the different presentations give you a different perspective on some things. After I sat in the Celestial room for a little while. It's just so peaceful and calm in there. I didn't really wanna leave, but after a while I just had to. Once we left we took a bunch of pictures outside. It was a good bunch of people there, so it was good. The rest of the day we were just in the office. Jerry and Davis are setting up a bunch of cambio stuff, so I just kinda hang out there and wait. Oh well, the day wasn't super great, but at least we went to the temple.</p>

                      <p>Happy Halloween!!! It's weird, last Halloween I was in the mission home with Elder Supayabe. It's only been a year, but a lot has changed. I'm just a lot older and mature. Anyways, most of the day was pretty normal. Just doing stuff in the office. At night was when it really got interesting. Around 7, after an appt cancelled, we went to the mission home to see the cambios. I wasn't nervous or anything, more just excited to find out. They were good cambios. Pretty close to my predictions. Elder Christensen is going to be ZL in Sucre central, and Calderon is leaving in a few weeks and Elder Hansen is going to be his replacement. Also, E' Saad is leaving and being replaced by E' Rhoton. After seeing the cambios, we ate milk and cookies with Pres Hansen. After that we went to Gringo Burger and ate dinner. We had good food, Rootbeer, and we took some Halloween pictures after. Overall, a pretty good and interesting day.</p>

                    <p>Wow, October already ended. I feel like I just started September. Anyways, today was a little bit crazy. The whole day was spent doing office things. We didn't get any time to work. I don't really remember the order of the places we went, but it included the offices like 3 times, terminal 2 times, the airport, lunch, the house, etc... We had lunch with the Flia Flores. It's weird, they used to think I was mean and boring, but now they love me and we get along great. They always like to joke about my finger (that I accidently cut it open once). They're a cool family. The worst part/best part of the day was the terminal. We were there for a long time. Like 2 hours. We had to send like 3 people off. While we were waiting we saw... Barrio Churuquella! At least a few members. They went to the temple this week. Best people I saw... FLIA AGUIRRE!!! Basically my favorite family from Bolivia. They're the best and I was so happy to see them. I miss them. Anyways, a long day, but throwback to Sucre.</p>

                    <p>Well, today was pretty good I guess. Church was good. Andres showed up which was good. Also the Flia Aguirre came. Fredy (the little one) cried when they left. Not fair. After church we taught Andres and it was awesome. The kid's amazing. He understands everything perfectly and is super interested. We taught him the Plan of Salvation and at times it was just funny how well he understood. My favorite part was when he exclaimed "wow, this plan is perfect". This kid is probably one of the best investigators I've met. After the lesson we had lunch with the Flia Antonio. We had a lesson with Genoveva and Teresa after that. For the rest of the day we had to do office stuff. We found out the flights on Tuesday (when we usually have them) are all full. Basically we ended up having to rent a bus to get people from Sucre to Cocha, and from Cocha to Sucre the flight is at 7:40. It was a little crazy, but we took control pretty well. Anyways, it was an eventful day, glad we've got p-day tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>Today was a good p-day. Everything was normal during most of was pretty normal. Email was good. I got to talk to Elder Gallegos a little. He's doing well, I was glad to hear from him. The family is doing well as well. In the afternoon we had a great afternoon. It might have been my idea... Anyways, we decided to play flag football. We had been planning it for a few weeks. We rented out a field, got a football from some white guy in Villa Moscu, and used socks and garbage bags for flags. It turned out really good. We had probably 19 guys, including the APs, us, Valerio, Coffing, Olson, Hansen, Porter, and a bunch of other guys. I had a few good catchs and it was really fun. Really hot though. The rest of the day was just spent in the office. Overall a pretty good day. Vega just got here, so it is getting busy now.</p>
