            <h1>Week 17 <small>(December 8, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Tired, just tired</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family and everyone else (I really have no idea who reads these),<br>
     This was a tiring week. Probably one of the best weeks we´ve had
here, but it was tiring. I literally almost passed out on saturday
cause I was so tired. We´re all good now, plus happy because of the
success we saw this week. Anyways, I'll go day by day, because
literally every day had something important for the most part.
<br><br>
Monday- We had a lesson at night. Great start to the week. We taught
Erica Calle and her family. Usually it's just her and her daughter,
but Monday we met the brother and the dad as well. We now have a whole
family, the Flia Teran Calle. They all seem really interested. We
talked a little about what they are looking for and what we can do to
help. We are really excited about the whole family.
<br><br>
Tuesday- Just regular office work day.
<br><br>
Wednesday- In the morning we had all the zone leaders at our house. 13
guys in a house is never fun. We had the leadership conference thing.
I kinda just let Vega decide what to give a presentation on. I'm so
ready to not have to give presentations anymore. However, I have a
reputation for making them all funny. This time I made a video, a
tribute to Elder Bagley in the offices. I'll put it on dropbox.
President came up to me after and said he loved it. Afterwards we had
Andres's baptismal interview. He was in there with Elder Mendoza for
like an hour. He passed though. Then he scared us, and got us worried.
He said that his mom signed him up for a new job, and he'd be working
on Saturday all day. I was really worried about that the rest of the
day. I didn't want to lose this baptism.
<br><br>
Thursday- Just about the most stressful day ever. In the morning we
had to get rid of all the zone leaders. Then we had a service project
with the Flia Vallejos (like the coolest people ever). While I was
there I got a call from Peru. I know it's never a good thing to get a
call from Peru, cause it means we have some important work to do.
Basically they told me I needed to revise something and get president
to sign it. Just more work to a busy day. After lunch we went to meet
Andres's mom. We called him like 15 times, but his phone was off. His
mom finally called us and invited us over. We got the permission and
got to know her a little bit. After that we had to split up. Vega and
Davis went to the airport to take care of some things, and I went with
Hansen and Mendoza (who had to come pick me up) to the office. I had
to prepare a little overview for president about the thing Peru called
about. After that we went to dinner. During this, Davis and Vega
taught another lesson to the Flia Teran Calle, where they met the 3rd
and final son. They said it went really well. After dinner, me,
Mendoza, and Hansen went up to the mission home so I could explain a
bunch of things to president. We got home around 9:30. We also passed
by the temple, which has lights up and looks cool.
<br><br>
Friday- Pretty calm. We had zone meeting in the morning. In the
afternoon we just worked in the offices. I had an interview with
President Hansen to get a new temple recommend. My current one lasts
till February, but I figured I might as well get a new one while I'm
in the office. The rest of the night was good too.
<br><br>
Satuday- WE HAD A BAPTISM!!!!!!! After a long drought, we got one.
Andres got work off, and showed up on time. We also had a bunch of
members come and even the Hansens. His friend baptized him, which was
cool because he first presented Andres to us, and he leaves on his
mission this Wednesday. It was a good baptismal service and Andres is
going to do great. It's the first baptism that a financial secretary
has had in at least 2 years, so I'm lucky to be here. Andres's mom
came, and from the beginning she was crying. It was really spiritual
and you can tell she felt something special. We're going to start
working on her now. After the baptism I went on an intercambio (just
more stress to the week). I went with Elder Rosario from the Dominican
Republic. His area is different from ours, plus it is like a giant
hill. I was so tired walking up that hill, after already being tired,
plus fasting. The pensionista there is cool. Her daughter served in
Temple Square, and is the video producer for 2 of the biggest bands in
all of Bolivia (Los Kjarkas and Chila J'atun). We got to go in the
recording studio which was cool. The first half of the day was tough.
No one was home and it was really hot. The second half was good. We
met some new investigators and taught some others. I learned a lot
from Elder Rosario. I came home and just slept at 10, cause I was
ready to die.
<br><br>
Sunday- We woke up early, because we promised Erica that we would go
with them to church. We woke up at 6, but Erica was actually all
ready. We went with her, and her husband and son came later. 3 people
at church is good, especially when we cant work in the field too much.
Andres showed up as well and I was priviledged to confirm him. He bore
his testimony, and it just sparked a cool energy in the ward. Everyone
is more excited to work, probably cause they saw a miracle in the
secretaries getting a baptism. I'm confident I'm leaving this area
with a lot of potential success. I trust Davis and Vega to keep it up.
Not sure why I always get baptisms within the last 2 weeks I have in
an area. In the afternoon we talked with some members, taught a less
active family, and taught another investigator.
<br><br>
Monday- We just went to the office in the morning, and then for lunch
we ate tucumanas with the Flia Flores in our ward. After that we
played wallyball with a few people from our zone and finally we got
haircuts. A solid day.
<br><br>
So that's my week, jam packed with all sorts of stuff. I feel good
about it though, and I'm excited to see what happens this week. I
should know my cambio on Saturday, so we'll see what happens. I'll let
you know about Christmas Skyping once I know where I'll be. Love you
guys so so so much, and I'll see you in 17 days.

                    <h3>December 2, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Today was pretty "tranquilo". We didn't have district or zone meeting, which was good. I used to love going to the meetings back when we had a cool zone, but it's just not as cool anymore. Most of the day was spent doing financieros. I get so bored on Tuesdays now, just letting Vega do everything. The one fun part was at night. I had a genius idea to make a video for the last consejo. I spent some time with Elder Vega and Elder Potts making it. I hope it goes well. That's it for the day. I'll end with a cool quote I found by Bruce Barton: "For good or ill, your conversation is your advertisement. For every time you open your mouth, you let me look into your mind. Do they see it neat and well-clothed and businesslike?"</p>

                    <h3>December 3, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Today was really good and stressful. We had the consejo for most the day. We gave our presentations and I did my best one ever. President was in a somewhat bad mood, so I was nervous, but it went great. I ended with a "Good-bye Elder Bagley" video. Everyone laughed and President told me he liked it. Afterwards Andres had his baptismal interview. Not surprisingly Mendoza made it a long one, like a whole hour. He passed, but then made us worried. I guess he got a new job that conflicts with his baptism and with church. We worried about it for the rest of the day. Something always has to happen, cause baptisms are never perfect. Oh well, if it needs to happen, we'll find a way to get around it for right now, that's priority #1.</p>

                    <h3>December 4, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Boy was today stressful. Firstly we had a service project in the morning. We helped the Flia Vallejos clean off their patioes. While we were there I got a call from the area finance guys telling me I needed to do something and talk to President by the end of the day. After lunch we went to the offices. While there we got a call from Andres's mom saying that we could meet with us. We ran over there and got to meet her. She's cool, different than I expected, but cool. She gave andres permission, he'll also be good for Saturday, so no worries there. After that we split up. I went with Hansen and Mendoza to the offices and Vega and Davis went to the airport. I prepared a report for Pres Hansen about the budget. We got a crappy budget from the area, so I told Pres what it should be, and he sent an angry letter to the area presidency and used my name (whoops). During this time, Davis and Vega had to teach a lesson. Crazy day, I'm tired, I'm sleeping.</p>

                    <h3>December 5, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Not a super exciting day. We had our district/zone meeting in the morning. I'm still not a real big fan of the zone, but it doesn't really matter, I'm leaving in 2 weeks. After that, and lunch, we just went to the office. At 4ish we went to the mission home. I had my temple recommend interview. Now being honest, I wanted an interview for 2 reasons. First, I wanted to get my recommend renewed while in the offices cause it's easier. Second, I was secretly hoping that President would ask where I wanted to go. Well, I got in there and we just burned through all the questions. Then he asked a question... about our baptism tomorrow. It's good he didn't ask where I wanted to go, that's not my decision. The rest of the day was spent in the offices. Off to bed, tomorrow is the big day.<br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <h3>December 6, 2014</h3>
                    <p>BBBBAPTISM!!!!! Andres got baptized today. It was pretty unstressful, as far baptisms go. We planned to have it start at 10, and we started at 10:30, not too bad. It was a good service. We had a bunch of people there. Even President and Hermana Hansen went. Andres bore a little testimony at the end and it was great. His mom came and was crying at the end. The members and the Hansens helped her a bunch. Afterwards we had an intercambio... kinda lame. I went with E' Rosario from the DR. He's awesome and stuff, but the area sucks. It's like a giant hill, the sun is terrible, and it just kinda sucks. We worked hard though. We didn't really have anything in the afternoon. At night we had a few good lessons. It was tougher cause we were fasting. It was a good learning experience. In a few weeks I'll be working like that everyday. Solid day though, got a baptism (miracle). Hope Andres keeps doing well, he could be a future missionary.</p>

                    <p>Solid Sunday. We woke up early to go pick up Erica Calle and take her to church. She was all ready, and her husband and son came later. Plus, we had Andres show up. I was privelaged enough to confirm him. 3 investigators at church and a recent convert. Not too shabby. After church we had 2 lessons. Firstly we taught the Flia Gallardo. They're really cool people, they just need to go to church. Afterwards we taught Gustavo Castro. We watched the "El es la Dádiva" video on their giant TV. Best way to watch it. I forgot to mention. Andres bore his testimony in sacrament meeting and it was great. Everyone told us how inspired they were by him. I really hope that the ward can take him in and help him. Anyways, it was probably my most stressful week here, but most successful too.</p>

                    <p>Somehow, today turned into a pretty solid p-day. We did internet in the morning and it was all normal and stuff. After that we went to the Flia Flores' house to eat tucumanas. They're a super cool family and the free food is always a plus. After that we headed over to play wally with most of the zone. It wasn't an official activity, but we had all of Cobija and Ingavi plus Barahona and Cardona. It was actually really fun. If our zone was comprised of those people it'd be a really good zone. Anyways, the rest of the day was pretty normal. It's kinda sad to think that I only have 1 more p-day in the offices. I'm gonna miss all the perks.</p>
