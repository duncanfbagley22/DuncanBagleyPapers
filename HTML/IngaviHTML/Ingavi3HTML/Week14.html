            <h1>Week 14 <small>(November 17, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>The Fast and the Furious</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
   This was a pretty good week. I´m sure you´re wondering what the
title means. Well, this week we were able to fast with Andres. I´ll
explain that later. There really wasn´t anything furious about this
week, it was just that I couldn´t think of a good rhyming word. Elder
Vega decided it´s cause I am "furiously happy". Anyways, this is what
happened this week.
<br><br>
Tuesday- Just a regular zone meeting and zone leader meetings. I like
having Elder Vega here now cause I can just let him do the meetings
and I dont get so bored.
<br><br>
Wednesday- eh...
<br><br>
Thursday- Woohoo, another lesson with Andres. We talked about tithing
and all that. We also talked about fasting. He has some pretty
important tests coming up, so we thought it could be a good idea to
fast with him. We set it up for Saturday. He´s still doing great. He
loves institute and notices the change the church has brought him in
his life. We´ve got a tentative date for November 29th, so hopefully
we get there.
<br><br>
Friday- We had another lesson, this time with a less active. Her name
is Maria Teresa. She was a pensionista for years and years and years.
She knows everything about the church, but was offended by the
members. Barrio Ingavi has quite the history of offending people.
There´s supposedly some family that´s always to blame, but we dont
know who it is. We´re just trying to keep the ward together, and not
focusing on blaming people. Anyways, the ward has always had trouble
with contacting her, cause she doesnt really want to talk to them.
However, me and Elder Christensen went there one day and she was
great. She didnt have time to meet, so we set up another day. We
talked to her on Friday and she just loves the missionaries. She
always is telling us how we´re angels and how she loved the
missionaries. We´re taking things really slow, but she shows signs of
progress.
<br><br>
Saturday- A lot of the morning was spent trying to clean the house.
Just imagine a house of 4 20yr old men that hasnt really been
organized well for 2 years. That´s what we´re dealing with. For lunch
we went to the members that live next door to us. In the afternoon we
had a hard time finding things to do. Ultimately we went to the
bishop´s house to talk with him. We talked a lot about the ward and
what we could do to help. The excitement in the ward is low, so we
want to get things going. The bishop is a good guy, and likes us, so
hopefully things pick up.
<br><br>
Sunday- Andres didnt go to church and we were kinda worried for a
little. I called him after the sacrament and he had some school test
that morning, so he couldnt come. He showed up at the end of the 3rd
hour though, and we talked to him after about the fast and then talked
about the law of chastity. Somehow he found a way to relate fasting
and chastity that worked perfectly and he just understood well. After
lunch we went around trying to find things to do for a while.
Eventually we talked to some members (probably some of the coolest
members in our ward, he´s also YM president) about life and what he
needed from us. We then set up a service project, got a reference, and
ate watermelon. A productive lesson. Finally at night we found some
good stuff. About 3 months ago me and Elder Christensen contacted this
lady at her house. Her brother was a less active and we were looking
for him, but found her. She said she was interested in learning more
because she had some family problems. We were super excited, but then
we could never get contact with her. We tried a bunch of times, but we
never found her. Finally yesterday we got a lesson with her and she´s
great. Her name is Erica and was also taught her daughter Angela. They
know a bunch about the church, have been to youth conference, and are
interested in joining a church. We´ve got another lesson on Thursday.
<br><br>
Monday- We played slowpitch softball. It was super fun and I played
well. I´m not usually good at baseball, so I´m glad I did well this
time.
<br><br>
So ya, there´s life. Elder Vega is doing well so far. We still need to
go over a lot of things, but he understands everything so far. I was
starting to get tired this week just from so much time in the office,
but finding new people has given me a boost. I love you guys so much,
have a great week.<br>
Elder Bagley

                    <h3>November 11, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Today wasn't super interesting, but it wasn't the worst day ever. We studied normal and everything and then we had a zone meeting. Our zone is decent, but not great. Our zone leaders are good, it's just that a few people in our zone that aren't my personal favorite. They're still children of God though... Afterwards we had all the zone leader meetings. It's weird cause there's a bunch of new zone leaders, so things are different. Me and Vega did things 50/50 today. He picks everything up really well, so this shouldn't be a super complicated. It's still kinda hard to hand over the reigns, but I'm getting used to it little by little. I'm trying to constantly have something for Vega to do, and to be a good example, so it's making me work better. Anyways, tomorrow should be a better training day.</p>

                    <p>Today wasn't super interesting. We spent most of the day in the office. I'm trying to explain everything the best I can. I make little guides and try to test Vega in everything I can. 6 weeks is going to be really necessary, just cause I want to explain everything perfectly. I know I can't make him perfect, but I need to try the best I can. At night we split up cause Mendoza needed a companion. Vega went to a service with Mendoza, and me and Davis went to work. We were literally 2 blocks away from our planned appointment, when the sisters called and said that they needed us at the chapel. We tried our best to get out of going, but we couldn't. We showed up to a little FHE in the chapel, in which there wasn't much purpose in us going there. Ah well, at least we tried to work.</p>

                    <p>Today was pretty similar to yesterday. Just more training for Elder Vega. In the afternoon we had an appointment with Andres. We always teach him in the Universidad stake center now. It's a good environment there and we always have a member with us. Today we talked about tithing and fasting. He had a few questions about tithing, mostly cause he was worried he would have to pay tithing even though he doesn't have a job. We clarified everything and then we talked about fasting. We found out that he had some tests coming up, so we decided it could be a good idea to fast with him. He was all for it. We decided that we'll start on Saturday. I've never fasted with an investigator, so I'm excited to see how it goes. The rest of the day was pretty boring. Oh well, Andres is doing well so I can't complain.</p>

                    <p>I'm pretty sure whoever is reading this is probably getting bored of the same things happening everyday, but it's just the way it is. Hopefully once I leave the offices it'll get a little bit more exciting. Today was similar to yesterday. The only real difference was that instead of teaching Andres, we taught Hna Maria Teresa. She's a less active, but she loves the missionaries. We're trying to just figure out what she needs at this point. The testimony is still there, we just need to get her over the hump and go to church. We're trying to get her going with the BoM for now. I guess her "problem" is her overly catholic, abusive, screaming, mormon hating, ill mom. Apparently that's part of it. Anyways, the rest of the day was just the office. Tomorrow's Saturday, so hopefully we can get some stuff done.</p>

                    <p>Today probably wasn't the most productively day in terms of numbers, but we did some productive spiritual things. The morning was regular. We studied and moved around a bunch of stuff in the house. We ate lunch with the Flia Robles (the people that live behind us). After that we went to go meet up with Andres to start the fast. I'm excited to see how the fast goes, I've never done it with an investigator before. After that we really couldn't find much going on. After walking for a while, we decided to go visit the bishop. We just talked about the ward a little and how we can help out more. The bishop's a good guy, he just says the ward is a little dead right. I think he was probably happy to talk to us, just cause we showed interest. The fast is currently going well, so hopefully we get through it all (and Andres).</p>

                    <h3>November 16, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Today was good. Church was normal. Andres didn't show up, so I was a little worried. I called him during sacrament meeting and he told me that he was at some mandatory school activity, but that he would show up as soon as he could. He showed up with like 5 minutes left, but at least he showed up. Best part was that he finished his fast with us. 100% complete. We were able to teach him a lesson and everything was good. We ate lunch at Nacho's and then we went looking for things to do. We visited the Flia Vallejos, and they're awesome. He's YM pres. They gave some references, and we're planning on a service project with them. Best part of the night was Erica Calle. We contacted her like 3 months ago, but we never had a lesson. I kept feeling like we should go there, and we did today. We finally got in the door and the family is great. We got to know her and her daughter Angela. They're going to be great investigators, and hopefully they progress. That's the day, pretty solid.</p>

                    <p>Today was a pretty fun P-day. We did most of our internet in the morning. For lunch we met up with the zone and we ate chinese food. The chinese food is surprisingly good (there's Jackie Chan chicken). The zone is decent enough. After that me, Vega, Davis, Stoker, Potts, and Rosario went out to Alalay to  play softball. We had a bunch of guys there for slow pitch softball. I did pretty well. 2-2 batting, didn't make an error on defense. Softball is a pretty fun sport. We had watermelon and took pictures. It was another great activity idea by yours truly. The rest of the day was pretty normal. The family is doing well. It's my dad's birthday tomorrow, so we took a funny picture and sent it to him. This should be a busy week, so we'll see how it goes.</p>
