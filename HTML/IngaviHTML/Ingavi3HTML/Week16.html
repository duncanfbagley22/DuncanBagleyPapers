            <h1>Week 16 <small>(December 1, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>The Day of Action of Thanks</h3>
            <p><small>Dear family,<br>
     I hope you all had a great "Dia de Acción de Gracias" this week.
That´s what Thanksgiving is called in spanish. It translates to Day of
Action of Thanks, not sure why, but whatever. This was a better week
than last week I guess. I feel like the only exciting weeks are
cambios week, and every other week is kinda just the same. It´s crazy
how fast time is going. Christmas is in like 24 days (actually,
exactly 24 days). I´m kinda bummed about one thing. I got to the
offices 1 week after the mothers day call, and I´m leaving a week
before the Christmas call. I´m never going to be able to use the good
internet in the offices to Skype. Bummer. Oh well, I´ll get to talking
about this week.
<br><br>
Monday- On Monday we had a zone BBQ at Hno Nacho´s (this cool guy in
our ward) house. Our zone isnt quite as fun as before, but it´s not
too bad. Nacho lived in Yacuiba, which is close to Argentina, so he´s
basically Argentino. Argentinian BBQs are really really good.
<br><br>
Tuesday- Nothing special most of the day, I got really bored while
Vega was working with the Zone Leaders. I´ve started doing any
possible office jobs I can, just to pass time. At night we had a
lesson with Erica Calle. She´s really interested in the church and
wants to be a part of it. We want to get her a testimony before we go
much further, but she definitely has the desires.
<br><br>
Wednesday- We had a lesson with Andres in the afternoon. We talked a
lot about the temple and marriage and stuff. He doesnt really want to
get married, but he told us he eventually will cause he wants to reach
Exaltation. Andres is the funnest person to teach. He understands
everything and doesnt need a ton of explaining. He also makes really
funny comments, like how he told us that the people in the Reino
Telestial (Telestial Kingdom) are people that do nothing important and
only watch tele (TV). He´s just golden. At night we had a little FHE
type thing in the ward. We´re trying to get it going to get the ward
more involved and united.
<br><br>
Thursday- Thanksgiving day. Not really a big deal for missionaries,
but we did have a good lunch. We ate with the less active family, and
they made us Pique lo Macho. It´s a traditional Cochabamba dish, and
when made well it is really good. We talked to them a little bit about
being thankful and we´re still trying to come up with a plan for them.
They are really delicate personalities, but we´ve got their trust now.
<br><br>
Friday- We went to a baptism for Nacho´s son, and then just stayed in
the offices. A regular day I guess.
<br><br>
Saturday- We did a service project in the morning with the
missionaries in the other ward. We just cleaned up a house and moved
furniture, nothing too bad. After lunch with members, we just had
stake conference meetings. Andres came with us to the Priesthood
session and enjoyed it. We had the priesthood meeting and the adult
meeting. Some of the conference was boring, but we did get to hear
from the 2nd counselor in the stake presidency. His name is Pres Teran
and he gives the best talks ever. Like he is the South American
version of Elder Holland. In one of his talks, he related ward counsel
to the story of Cain and Abel. When God asked Cain where Abel was he
said "I don´t know, am I my brother´s keeper". He went on to explain
that yes, we are our brother´s keeper, and when God asks we should
already know where our brothers are. We need to watch over our
brethren and know where people are and what´s going on with them. I
didnt explain his talk as well as it deserves, but it was really good.
<br><br>
Sunday- More stake conference. Andres showed up, and afterwards we
went over the last few things before baptism. He´s all ready to go,
and laughed at how simple the interview questions are. His baptism is
Saturday morning. We had just one lesson in the afternoon. We taught a
less active lady who is tough. She´s one of those people that thinks
the members need to be perfect. She´s got a testimony of everything,
but just doesnt really get along with people. We taught a few things,
gave 2 blessings, and invited her to Andres´s baptism. We looked for a
bunch of people after that, but only ended up setting up some
appointments.
<br><br>
Monday- We are planning on going to the Cancha (big marketplace) to
buy stuff today. My plan is to hopefully send some Christmas stuff
back with one of the missionaries going home on Dec 17th, kinda like I
did last year. I´ll let you know the details of who it is and where
they live. I´m also going to try to send something to Griff with one
of the missionaries that live in his mission.
<br><br>
Anyways, that is the week. I´m definitely ready to leave the offices
(17 days), just to be normal again. I love you guys so much, and I´ll
talk to you in 24 days.<br>
Love,<br>
  Elder Bagley

                    <p>Today was pretty good/boring. We had district meeting in the morning. We talked about the atonement and we bore our testimonies of it. It was pretty good. After lunch we went to the offices for financieros. Financieros are pretty boring now. Vega does all the work and I just sit and watch. I don't miss doing them though. 5hrs without leaving the chair is tough. Vega got the hang of it, so I really just do nothing. At night we left and went to a lesson with Erica calle. It was good, but I feel like we aren't really doing our part. She's got the right desires, but no direction. She wants to learn, but we don't give her what she needs. I left a little dissappointed, but glad we've got her. We just need to plan our lessons, and it'll turn out ok. That's all for today, see you tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>Today was just another day. In the morning we just stayed in the offices. Nothing too exciting, just regular office stuff. After lunch we had a lesson with Andres. It went well. We talked to him about the temple and marriage and enduring to the end. He doesn't really want to get married, but he said he will to be reach exaltation. We've got the baptism set for December 6th at 10am. I'm excited. After that we just went back to the offices. After working int he offices, we went to the chapel at night for the Noche de Hermanamiento. We taught a quick lesson on hope, followed by some games. There aren't a ton of people, but there're enough to have a good time. That's what we did today, not too special, but not bad.</p>

                    <p>Happy Thanksgiving!!! It's not super cool when your a missionary, at least in Bolivia. We were hoping to eat Thanksgiving dinner in the mission home, but the Hansen's are out of town. Instead, we had lunch with Maria Teresa and Bridget. It was Pique lo macho, and it was good. That's a hit or miss dish, and this time it was a hit. Afterwards we shared a quick message about being thankful. They're both nice and we get along with them, but they aren't showing much interest in going back to church. We'll see what happens though. The rest of the day was spent at the office. We've been trying to contact all of the taxi drivers we meet, which is fun. It's the best we can do. Tomorrow should be pretty normal, but we'll see.</p>

                    <p>Not exactly the most exciting day today. The morning was normal, just studying and all that. Then we just went to the offices. After lunch we went to a baptism. Nacho's son, Wilmer, got baptized. It was a good service. I feel like we owe Nacho's family a lot, just cause they help us out so much. I got to direct the service, something I've done way too many times. After the baptism we just headed to the offices. We had hoped that Andres could go, but he couldn't attend. At night we played a game to see who contacted the next taxi driver. We just shoot at the nerf hoop, last one to make it contacts. Somehow Vega always makes it quick, and I always lose. Surprising. Oh well, contacting isn't too bad. Stake Conference is tomorrow, so that'll be the bulk of our day.</p>

                    <p>I enjoyed today, for the most part. In the morning we were supposed to have a service with the Flia Vallejos, but they couldn't and we ended up doing service with Hansen and Rosario. We cleaned out a house basically. For some reason we talked about pirates the whole time. It wasn't too bad of a service. We did eat lunch with the Flia Vallejos. They're probably one of the coolest families in our ward. In the afternoon we had stake conference. Andres came to the priesthood session which was cool. He was pretty proud of coming. One cool thing is that the 2nd counselor in the stake presidency is just super awesome. He gives talks that are general conference caliber. One about ward council and how if we don't kknow where our brothers are, we're like Cain not knowing where Abel is. Just great stuff. Tomorrow has more stake conference, so we'll see what happens.</p>

                    <p>More stake conference! Andres showed up to the whole session. He's got like twice as many attendances as he needs for baptism. Conference was good, there was a bunch of people there. Afterwards we had a final lesson with Andres before his baptism. He's all ready for next saturday. We ate lunch with the Flia Garcia. They're a super cool. I'm definitely going to miss eating with members. In the afternoon we had a lesson with Maria Pantoja. She's very knowledgable, but she thinks the members in the ward need to be more perfect. We taught a little, gave her and her grandma a blessing, and then got on our merry little way. That's the bulk of the day, p-day should be good I hope.</p>

                    <p>Wow, it's already December. I remember last December, I felt really old. Now it's december again. Last month of the year. Today was a pretty good p-day, but it was stressful. The morning was pretty normal, just internet and stuff. However, we found out that they were delaying/cancelling all the flights out of Sucre. President and the APs were in Sucre and needed to get to Cocha. Davis was a little stressed, but we just ended up booking a flight for tomorrow. After that we went to the Cancha. I went through a bunch of money, but it was on Christmas gifts. We also bought some tire sandals. The cancha is cool, but I'm always super tired after I go. We played a little bit of nerfball after, but for the most part it was all pretty "tranquilo". This week should be busy, but hopefully it's good.</p>
