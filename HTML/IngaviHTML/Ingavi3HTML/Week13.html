            <h1>Week 13 <small>(November 10, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Sweet Child O´Mine</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
   Well, this was a long week. It was one of the most tiring weeks in
recent memory. Probably because we got up at 4:30 on Tuesday, 6 on
Wednesday, 5:30 on Friday, and 5:30 on Saturday. Needless to say, we
were tired. Anyways, being a busy week, it was also fun to have a lot
of things to do. Elder Vega got here on Monday night and it´s been
fun. Him and Elder Davis are pretty low maintenance and easy to get
along with. They are both obedient and want to work. It´s gonna be a
good cambio. It´s kinda weird to have to train somebody here and to
have to let go of the reigns a little. It´ll be weird to get used to
it, but it´ll come. Elder Vega is doing great though. He understands
things really well and is patient, so he´ll be able to get everything
down in 6 weeks. I´m actually kinda glad to stay with these guys for a
whole cambio. As far as the week, this is what happened...
<br><br>
Monday- For our activity we set up a game of flag football between a
bunch of elders. We rented out a turf field and used socks for the
flags. There is a white guy in the APs ward that has a football. It
was really fun. One of my better ideas. Also, Elder Vega showed up
Monday night.
<br><br>
Tuesday- We got a new batch of missionaries. We got some from Provo,
Peru, Colombia, and Mexico, so we spent a lot of time in the airport.
We had to get up really early though because the flight for the people
leaving Cochabamba left really early this time. Tuesday night was
suuuuuuper funny. One of the elders (surprisingly, out of 9
missionaries, none were from Utah) got a package that had fake
moustaches in it. Well, we had a good time with them. There are a lot
of pictures of me, Elder Davis, and Elder Crankshaw (the AP). We were
dying cause it was so funny. The new missionaries are great. It´s good
to know the mission will be in good hands in the future.
<br><br>
Wednesday- We got up early again and went to the Cristo statue like we
do every cambio now. It´s cool because President Hansen talks to
everyone about the mission and usually has cool stories to share.
After that we went to the mission home for a training meeting. We also
got to eat in the mission home, which is always great. Wednesday
afternoon I tried to get Elder Vega started with the office. There´s a
lot to learn, so I need to make sure we cover everything. Wednesday
night was also great. We were waiting for around hour for some
missionaries to get to the hotel, so me and Elder Davis took advantage
of the time and made up a secret handshake. We dont have a video, but
I´ll get one to you one day.
<br><br>
Thursday- The only real major thing is that we had a lesson with
Andres. We met up with him after institute (ya, he goes to institute
every week) and talked a little more about the Book of Mormon. He´s
still doing great. We had to have a short lesson because we had to be
in the office for the zone leader meetings.
<br><br>
Friday- Nothing too special I guess. We played dunkball with the zone
leaders in our house in the morning and it was really fun. After that
we had the leadership conference. We had to give our little
presentation and we made Pres and Hna Hansen laugh while giving some
valuable information, so mission accomplished. During lunch me and
Elder Davis performed our secret handshake for everyone and we got
some applause. I´m glad this is my 2nd to last conference, just cause
I´m tired of giving presentations to everyone.
<br><br>
Saturday- Played dunkball again. We had a problem though as Elder
Davis was super sick. We just let him sleep most of the morning. We
went to lunch, ate there, and then had to go back because he was
worse. We had plans at 4, so we decided to let him sleep until then.
When he woke up he was fine, so all is well. At 4 there was a
celebration for the 50yr anniversary of the church in Bolivia. We had
to take an investigator, so we went with Andres. It was a festival of
dancing and they had a documentary about the church in Bolivia. It was
cool to be there. It ended around 7 or 8, so after that we just went
to dinner and then home.
<br><br>
Sunday- Church was normal. Andres came so he has all the attendance he
needs for baptism now. We taught him afterwards and... well actually
he taught himself. We were going to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ,
but Andres did it better. He explained repentance perfectly and even
set his own baptismal date without us asking. He´s already really
excited about everything in the church. He wants to get the
priesthood, go on a mission to Africa, and is just great. He
understood the Book of Mormon really well. His tentative date is the
29th of November. We had lunch with some members afterwards and then a
lesson with a less active. Her name is Maria Teresa. She was a
pensionista for years, but the members were losers and now she and her
daughter are inactive. You can tell she knows it´s true, she just
needs to go back. We have another appointment on Friday.
<br><br>
Monday- Just low key. We got haircuts, went to lunch, and did email.
We got a text from Andres last night saying he wanted to talk to us.
We were worried what it was. We talked to him and he had a crazy
dream/experience and was just kinda scared. I explained to him the
story of Joseph Smith first vision where he was taken by some force
before seeing God and Christ. He said that was really similar. We
helped to calm him down and gave him a blessing. It was good to be
able to help him, he´s still doing great, don´t worry.
<br><br>
So there´s the week. I was really tired all week, so I´m glad this one
should be low key. I love you guys so much. Make sure to pray for
Andres, just so we can keep him progressing. Keep up the good work, be
good, go to church, return with honor, and watch for cars because they
wont watch for you.<br>
Love,<br>
  elder Bagley

                    <h3>November 4, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Today was good and tiring. We had to get 4:30 so that we could get to the airport early. We had to stay at the airport for quite some to pick up a few missionaries. After that we had lunch with all the new missionaries and some trainers. Every time we do that I always feel like a waiter, it kinda sucks. Most of the rest of the day was spent in the airport. It was a little weird cause an Hermana Black going home and she lives like 5min from my house. After that we received a few more missionaries. There's a guy named Elder June who Vega decided to call him Maximiliano W Junio. Everytime the new missionaries get here we sing Called to Serve, it's kinda weird, but kinda cool at the same time. At night we had a great time. Me, Davis, and Crankshaw got some fake moustaches from a new elder and tooks tons of pictures. Memorable stuff. Anyways, kinda long day, but it was fun.</p>

                    <p>We got up early again, but not as early. It was only like 5:30/6 this time. In the morning we went up to the Cristo Statue with all the news and the trainers. There was a cool little meeting with the Hansens and Pres Hansen shared some cool stories. We took a few pictures and then headed back down. Afterwards we went to the mission home. We got to eat lunch there, which is always great, and then we had a little training meeting. I'm getting tired of giving presentations, so I'm glad I'm leaving soon. In the afternoon we were just at the offices. I'm glad to have 6 weeks to train Vega. I won't have to rush and I'll be able to explain everything. We had a really good time at night. We got to the hotel with dinner, but no one was there. We had to wait for like an hour, so me and Davis came up with a great secret handshake that includes small dances, being mimes, and waltzing. It's great. Long day, probably another one tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>Today was actually good I guess. The morning was pretty normal. All the trainers and new guys left. In the offices I'm having a hard time deciding what to have Vega do and what I should do. I want to have him busy, but I can't have him do everything. After going to the pension for the first time this week, we went to the Universidad stake center to teach Andres. We taught the 4 of us (Me, Vega, Davis, and Christensen). It was kinda weird to teach with 3 other people. We talked a little bit about the Book of Mormon, and a bunch of random things. He's still doing great. The rest of the day we just did financieros. I'm gonna be so glad when I don't have to do these anymore. Hopefully in about 2 weeks Vega can handle them all. All the zone leaders are in the house now, so the week will keep being busy. Oh well, Vega is doing great so I think it'll be a good cambio.</p>

                    <p>Woohoo, consejo day!!! Just kidding, I'm not really a fan of consejo anymore. I've probably done it 5 or 6 times, so it's getting old. We played dunkball in the morning so at least that was fun. We were just in the offices in the morning, preparing the presentation. We gave it, made people laugh, and then ended. Consejo is even worse now cause I have to serve Christensen and Valerio. Oh well, just one more of these till I'm gone. During lunch me and Davis performed our new secret handshake, to which we received a strong applause. President Hansen pulled me aside to tell me I needed a haircut, so that was a little embarassing. The rest of the day was pretty normal. We saw Andres at the stake center, so it's good to know that he's doing well. Vega is still doing well, he understands everything I throw at him. Not sure what we're going to do tomorrow, but hopefully it's good.<br><br></p>

                    <p>Today was pretty good, at least for me. We woke up and played dunkball again. Davis didn't play cause he was sick. The whole morning Davis was just really sick. We sent the ZLs off on their own, and we stayed home with Davis. We ate lunch with the Flia Terceros. It was great and all, but Davis kep on being sick, so we went back home to let him rest. He was in rough shape. We had to go at 4 though. We went with Andres to the 50yr celebration of the church in Bovilia. It was in a big stadium and it was pretty cool. They had dances, singing, and a cool little documentary movie. There was a bunch of people there, and it was cool to see the history of the church here. After that we just took Andres home and then went to dinner. It was a good day, nothing to complain about. Hopefully Davis feels better.</p>

                    <p>Just a regular sunday. The meetings were normal. The 2nd counselor in the stake presidency spoke in sacrament meeting which was cool. He probably the best speaker I've seen here. Andres was there too, so now he's got all the attendance he needs to be baptized. We taught him after church about the gospel of Jesus Christ. He understands so well. After he explained repentance (which he did perfectly) Vega said "usually we say that we testify of the words of our companion, but in this case I'll testify of the words of the investigator". After the lesson we went to lunch with the Flia Giacoman. Their cool and the husband tolds us of all his travelling while working for BOA. In the afternoon we talked to Hna Maria Teresa. She's been a member forever, a pensionista, but because of member problems she's inactive. You can tell she knows it's true, but we just need to get her back to church. The rest of the day was pretty low key. Oh well, it was a long week with cambios and stuff so I'm kinda glad it's over.</p>

                    <p>Woohoo, P-day. This was a little different than the regular p-day. We woke up to a text from Andres saying that something weird happened to him and he wanted to meet with us. That was the center of the day after that. We had a regular morning and just did email and stuff. We went to lunch at IC Norte and then we went to the park to meet with Andres. We met with him and he was kind of a mess. He said he had a weird dream and just a weird experience. He was pretty worried, but we helped him calm down and eventually gave him a blessing. I like how he came to us for help, knowing that we could help. The rest of the day just involved me going to get a haircut (which was difficult for some reason) and then we just stayed in the office. We're finally gonna start with Vega's training, so this week will be interesting.</p>
