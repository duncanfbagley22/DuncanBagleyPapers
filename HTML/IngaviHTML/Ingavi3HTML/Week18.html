            <h1>Week 18 <small>(December 15, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Let's skip the creative title nonsense, this email is about where Elder Bagley got transfered to...</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,
     So nothing really exciting happened this week... 
<br><br><br><br><br><br>







Nah, just kidding. We had quite the week this week. Actually, most of it was spent in the offices. With cambios, especially 34 people going home tomorrow, we had a bunch of stuff to do. Also, I got my cambio. Usually they finish the cambios on Friday or Saturday, but this week they finished on Thursday afternoon. As soon as I found out I got super nervous. We drove up to the mission home and the whole time I was nervous. I was running around in circles in the office. When we got there President told me he wanted to talk to me alone. He brought me aside to give me my new assignment. Here are the details...<br><br>

Where- I am going to the Villa Graciela ward. It's on the easternish side of the Cochabamba valley. I dont really know a ton about that side of the valley, so I can't tell you much.<br><br>

Who- I am going to be with *drumroll* Elder Laidlaw. Probably the best missionary ever. He was in my zone for 3 cambios here (just look at all the zone pictures, he's the really tall guy) and I know him pretty well. I am super excited. He´s a great missionary and friend, and I'm really grateful to be with him. He's from Los Angeles. He goes home in March, so there's a good chance that I'll be his last companion.<br><br>

What- We are going to be the zone leaders of the new Sacaba zone. There used to be a Villa Graciela and a Sacaba zone, but they just combined those 2 zones. We are going to have 26 missionaries in our zones, an entire stake. We´ve got a bunch of cool missionaries, so it should be fun. Elder Laidlaw was probably the best zone leader I´ve had so far, so I´m sure he´ll help me figure things out<br><br>

So ya, that´s my cambio. I talked to Elder Laidlaw this morning and he´s excited as well. He said that the ward is great and we have a few good investigators already. Also, I asked him about SKYPE. He said we have a super rich bishop that has internet and tablets and stuff, so I assume we´ll go there. I don´t know any details, but I´ll find them out for next week. Overall, I really can't complain about my cambio. It´s as good as I could hope for. <br><br>

The rest of the week was pretty boring. We´ve been teaching the Flia Teran Calle a lot. Up until Saturday it was great. They were/are reading and are super cool. The dad even bought a case for his Book of Mormon. He could be a bishop one day. We went with the mom and uncle on Tuesday to give their mom a blessing. Everything was going perfect. However, Elder Davis got a call on Saturday and they cancelled the appointment. We don't really know why. Then on Sunday, the worst thing happened. We were sitting there during the sacrament, when we saw the mom come in. I guess she saw that the door was closed, felt bad that she showed up late, and left. We ran out after and called her, but she was already home. I felt terrible. There wasn't anything we could do either, that's the worst part. I'll be gone, but I hope that Davis and Vega can help them.<br><br>

On the bright side, Andres is doing well. He came to church yesterday and was super excited to get his certificate of his baptism. We talked to him a little bit in the afternoon and we are going to go to lunch with him today. I'm excited to hear about his progress in the future. <br><br>

Last night was really fun. We got invited to a pancake dinner at the mission home. We got to eat pancakes and bacon and homemade syrup. It was just us 5, the APs, and the Hansens. Afterwards we took some funny Christmas pictures that made the Hansens laugh out loud (that´s a pretty impressive accomplishment if you know President Hansen). <br><br>

So that's a very abstract look at this week. This next week includes transfers, saying good bye to a bunch of my mission buddies, and going to my new area. I'm excited. I hope everything is going well at home, and I will talk to you in 10 days. Love you.<br>
Love,<br>
   Elder Bagley

                    <p>Today was pretty good I guess. It started out normal. Just studies and then to the district meeting. I'm not gonna lie, pretty glad it's my last one in this zone. After that and lunch, we went to the offices. We had our little zone leader meetings, which is also something I'm not going to miss. I'll miss seeing everyone, but not doing that boring stuff every Tuesday. We hurried (and by we I mean E' Vega) and finished up, so we could go to our lesson with the Flia Teran Calle. We showed up and she (Erica) asked if we could go see her mom. We hopped in the car and headed up with her and her brother and we gave her mom a blessing. Not exactly what we had planned, but I'm sure it helped. That was my last office Tuesday, kinda weird.</p>

                    <h3>December 10, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Not a super exciting day today. Really, it was just a regular office day. We were supposed to have a service project with the Flia Vallejos, but it fell through, so we just studied. That, and we tried to fix our house. We had the house owner and his gringo son-in-law at our house fixing a drainage problem. The roof was leaking a ton, but it's good now. After that, we just went to the office. I'm starting to get nervous about forgetting to teach Vega something or not doing it well. I trust him 100%, it's just more of me not trusting myself. I'm hoping he'll just figure out anything that I miss. It's officially about a week until I'm back in the field. I'm even more nervous about that, but I'm sure I'll pick it up again.</p>

                    <p>Well, nothing cool happened today, except for the fact that we found out about cambios!!! Today wasn't supposed to be important. We were just going to do office stuff. In the aftenroon Davis got a call from President saying the cambios were done. At that moment I got so nervous. I was running around in circles out of nervousness. When we got to the mission home, President pulled me aside and told me. He asked me if I would accept the assignment, as a ZL in Villa Graciela over the new, giant Sacaba zone. I said yes, and he said my comp would be Elder Laidlaw. Needless to say, awesome. After that we saw the rest of the cambios, and then to end the day we had a solid lesson with the Flia Teran Calle. They're great and the dad could be a bishop. So ya, that's how this day became so important. Now I ahve to wait 3 days before I tell anyone.</p>

                    <p>Today wasn't super interesting. In the morning we went to the airport to pick up all the missionaries going home from outside of Cocha. It's pretty weird to have some of these guys going home, like Elder Weekes, Elder Roth, and Elder Severiano. I remember when they had like 6 months, and now they're finishing. A lot are going home a transfer early, but it's still weird. After talking with those guys for a bit, we just went to the office. It was a regular day for most of the time. One cool thing was that I was able to talk to the Flia Plaza from Sucre. We reactivated them with Elder Lopez, but they are going through rough times again. They're getting better, and they wanted to talk to me, so that's cool. I miss Sucre.<br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <h3>December 13, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Last Saturday in the offices. The cambio saturday is usually spent doing office stuff. We woke up in the morning and got the "great" surprise of having Elder Muñoz walking around our house naked. He, E' villa, and E' Chavez are staying in our house for the next few days, and it's pretty annoying. I can't wait till I just live as me and Laidlaw. Some thing I'll miss about the office, others not so much. We also went to the photo center to get pictures for the old guys, and we went to the temple. I saw Rosella from El Paso there, so that was awesome. It was weird to see all the Hermanas from my group taking pictures, cause they're going home. Oh well, 6 more months for me. I like being a missionary though, so I know that I'll enjoy it.</p>

                    <p>Today started kinda bad, but it ended well. We got to church and everything was normal. Andres showed up a little late, but at least he showed up. He comes just on his own now, without his friend. Bad part, while the sacrament was going on, Erica Calle showed up. She felt embarassed cause she couldn't go in the sacrament cause she showed up late. We tried to catch her after, but she was already home. Really demoralizing.</p>
