            <h1>Week 15 <small>(November 24, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Doin Work</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
   This was quite the week. To easily sum up how it was, by the end of
the week, I probably had gotten 5 comments from different people about
how tired I looked. Elder Vega fell asleep during lunch. I fell asleep
during gospel principles. It was a LONG week. I´m not complaining
though, we got a lot done and had a good time. This is what
happened...
<br><br>
Tuesday- So Monday we found out that there were zone conferences on
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. The problem with that is that it
meant that we needed to supply lunch for 180 missionaries with one
day´s notice and have cash to pay for it (sometimes my job sounds so
boring when I think of it from anyone else´s point of view). That
threw a wrench in our plans for the week. We had that, on top of 3
weeks worth of work, to do in 1 week. Tuesday was just a regular zone
leader meeting day, but now Elder Vega does it. Usually I could just
sit there and watch, but I had to spend a bunch of time running around
doing other stuff.
<br><br>
Wednesday- Zone Conference. Woohoo! We had a solid zone conference
with President Hansen. We just talked about a bunch of things. The
most spiritual part was when president was reading letters from
missionaries. There was an hermana that had to go home a few months
ago because they found out that she had a brain tumor. Well, we fasted
as a mission, and president said that she was going to be ok. I guess
this whole time in the hospital, she´s just been working hard as a
missionary. She´s contacted like 100 people and some of the people are
getting baptized. Firstly it was cool to find out that she was going
to be ok. Second, it was just kinda inspiring to see how hard she´s
been working, even though she´s been going through this whole surgery
thing. Definitely made me want to work harder.
<br><br>
Thursday- We had a lesson with Maria Teresa, our less active. She´s a
delicate situation, but she´s starting to open up to us. She even
invited us to lunch next Thursday (Thanksgiving) and apparently she is
an amazing cook, so happy thanksgiving to us. We´re trying to just get
her reading again, because when she talks about church things you can
tell she still has a testimony. We also taught our new investigators,
Erica and Angela. They are some of those people that are a little too
open sometimes. They automatically believe everything we say, which
can be bad. We want them to really get their own testimony of the
gospel, that way there wont be anything in their way.
<br><br>
Friday- We got together with Andres again. He´s doing well. We were
really worried cause he hadnt been reading, but we got there on Friday
and he said he´s been reading. He understood the lesson really well
and is still just incredible. We changed his date to Dec 6th, just
because of stake conference and stuff. He´s really excited, and keeps
telling us how he´s inviting everybody.
<br><br>
Saturday- Poop. We had a service project planned, lunch with a member,
and a lesson with Erica and Angela. All 3 fell through. We´re doing
the service project next week, the member just gave us money, and
Erica cancelled. So, we ended up all day in the office. Work just
piled up and came out of nowhere. We ate lunch at Burger King, which
was just a really weird feeling. We didnt rest at all, and ended at
like 9. Long day
<br><br>
Sunday- We had church just like normal. Andres came to church, so all
is well there. We had to split up after church. Vega and Davis taught
Andres, and I went to ward council. Ward council is getting better,
the leaders are picking things up. After church we ate lunch with the
first counselor, who gave us a lot of less actives and looks like he´s
going to help out a lot. The rest of the day was spent in the airport,
doing some mission business.
<br><br>
Anyways, it was a long week. I´m still a little tired, but p-day
should help me rest. Lately I´ve been reading this book by Clayton
Christensen called "the power of the everyday missionary" (it´s Elder
Davis´s book). It is a really good book, and gives a lot of great
ideas of how to be a good member missionary. I highly recommend it. I
love you guys so much, and I hope you have a great thanksgiving.
Love,<br>
   Elder Bagley<br>
p.s my quote of the week that I found. It´s helped me to work harder<br>

                    <h3>November 18, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Today wasn't super exciting, but it was a little bit stressful. We didn't have zone meeting or district meeting because of the zone conferences this week. That was probably a good thing, cause all the financieros were pretty easy. I let Vega do them all by himself and he did well. Tuesdays normally would be full of nothing for me, but today we had a bunch of things come out of nowhere that I had to deal with. They decided to tell us this morning, so we had to get 180 meals for the next 3 days. That plus everything we have this week should make it "fun". I can already tell that it's going to be a long week. Oh well, if I'm busy at least I'm being productive. Last of all, happy birthday to Troy Bagley my father. The best father ever.</p>

                    <p>Conferece day!!! We got all ready and stuff (nos pusimos guapos) and we head to the conference around 8:15. We got all of the lunch stuff set up and then had the conference. We learned a bunch of good stuff. President talked about being a "full purpose missionary". The assistants talked about setting goals. Lunch turned out well, we had all the food there and set up. It was funy cause just as Hansen ended his phone call with the food place, the delivery car showed up. Later we had people give some talks, there were some practices, and Pres read letters from missionaries. It was really cool to here from Hna Zavaleta, an hermana that went home with a brain tumor. She's got it removed an is recovering. She still working hard as a missionary, just contacting everyone. The rest of the day was spent taking pics for the ancianos, and doing office work. Decent day overall.</p>

                    <p>Today was a solid work day. It's always good when we get 2 lessons in. There was a zone conference for other zones in the morning. After lunch we had a lesson with Maria Teresa and Bridget. They've started to like us, but we haven't made a bunch of progress spiritually. We're just gonna try to explain the basics. We've got lunch with them next week, so that's a bonus. After that we just went back to the offices to do some work. We've gone through 4000bs just on lunch the last 2 days, so we're running a little low. At night we had a lesson with Erica and Angela. They are doing well, we just need to teach better. We aren't involving them enough, so lessons aren't super effective yet. Teaching in a trio is hard, so we're going to be working on how to do it better. Tomorrow should be pretty similar to today, but we'll see what happens.</p>

                    <h3>November 21, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Today I felt like a real missionary. With a lesson with Andres planned, we decided that we needed to plan well for the lesson. The only thing missing for him was that he wasn't consistently reading the BoM. We planned a great lesson. We went to lunch all normal, and then we went to the lesson. Turns out that he read, so that worry was cleared up. We really nailed the lesson though, and he even made the comment that it was a great lesson. Afterwards we went into the chapel to get some info from missionaries at the zone conference. We need to talk to every area about stuff, it's fun. Everyone there commented about how inspiring I am (in an "inspiring people" section of the conference, my face appears along side Ghandi, Mother Teresa, and Nelson Mandela). Anyways, looks like we'll be in the offices tomorrow, so that really sucks. Oh well, I'm happy, we've got a firm baptismal date for December 6th, woohoo!!!</p>

                    <p>Well, today was boring. We had plans to have a service project in the morning and a lesson in the afternoon, but both of them fell through. We ended up in the offices all day instead. Vega had a bunch of stuff to do, so I just had him do it and I kinda did nothing. Our lunch fell through too, but she gave us money. We ended up going to Burger King. It was a really weird feeling there, just cause it's such an american restaurant. The rest of the day was just more of the offices. It was really boring, but we had to do it. We ended up leaving at 9pm. I really hate being in the offices on Saturdays, but ya just gotta do it sometimes. Oh well, I'll be a normal missionary one day. </p>

                    <p>Today, was on of those terrible sundays where we have to go to do office work. Church was all normal. Andres came a little late, but he came. After church we split up. I went by myself to ward council, and Davis and Vega taught Andres. I'm not sure what they spoke about, but I'm sure it was good though. Ward council was good enough. The auxilary leaders aren't great, but they're improving. We had lunch with the 1st counselor, Hno Fernandez. Cool family, and we got some less active references. The rest of the day was spent at the airport. Elder Alvarado decided to go home, so we had to be there. Not sure how people go 9 months then go home. Oh well, we just talked to Toomer and Moreano the whole time. P-day tomorrow, woo!!!</p>

                    <p>Today was a decent p-day I guess. I had the unfortunate luck of having to go with Elder Severiano to tramites. We drew lots, and me and Hansen lost. Because of this, we went at like 8 to go do tramites. After finishing it all up, we headed over to some marketplace so Hansen could buy some shoes. We took a trufi there, probably the first regular trufi I've taken in the last 4ish months. After that we just went to the offices to do email. For lunch we went with the zone. We had a BBQ at Nacho's house, and as always, it was delicious. Our zone is cool enough, I just hung with E' Rosario, E' Barahona, and E' Diazgranados. The rest of the day was just spent in the offices. We played a lot of nerf basketball, like 1 vs 1, 3pt contest and stuff like that. The day was entertaining and relaxing, all I can ask for in a p-day.</p>
