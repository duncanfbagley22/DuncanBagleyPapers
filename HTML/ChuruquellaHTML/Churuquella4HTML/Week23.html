            <h1>Week 23 <small>(January 6, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Dos Mil Catorce</h3>
            <p><small>Happy New Year!<br>It is crazy that it is already 2014. I am in my only full year in
            the mission. New years was uneventful for us. We got home, and ended
            up falling asleep at like 10. We did make scones the next morning
            though, so everyone was happy. This week brought something good...
            Like Dennys´s baptism! It was great. We had to show up to church at 6
            to fill and heat the font in time. However, everything worked out and
            we even had all the youth of the ward there, so that helped. We also
            had breakfast at his house after. We werent sure that the baptism was
            going to go through, as his mom is just a little weird, and his real
            dad was here for the first time in 3 years from Brazil, and we werent
            sure about him. When I was praying that morning though, a voice told
            me everything would be ok, so that calmed me down a bit. Everything
            worked, I baptized him and Pinta confirmed him. It was awesome. Today
            we went to the 7 cascadas (waterfalls) again and this time we climbed
            more. Some people even fell all the way in the water, but not me and
            Pinta, cause we are awesome. There´ll be some good pictures of that
            eventually, when the other elders pass them to me. As for the other
            investigators, only Karla is progressing. She´ll be baptized the 25th,
            and I am pretty confident itll happen. She has a testimony and support
            of the ward and everything. Dina for some reason didnt come to church
            yesterday. She is still House Hunting Bolivia, and sometimes that
            takes times away. We will figure it out though. We met some other cool
            people this week. Hno Fredy (Oliver´s dad) gave us a reference of
            someone that used to come to church, but stopped cause they moved. Her
            name is Cristina and her daughter Estrellita Divina (Divine little
            star? Bolivians are weird). Anyways, the only hard part is getting her
            to understand everything. We had to invite her to pray like 4 times
            cause she didnt understand the question. We also met Yascara (why cant
            they have normal names). She is really curious. She also has a nice
            house and makes good food. The BoM sparked her interest. Other than
            that, we have a few good people, but everyone is traveling, which
            makes it hard. It is weird that this could be my last week. This is
            the only area I have ever known. We will find out Sunday whats up. I
            am excited to see what happens. Love you guys, and hope everything
            keeps going well. Church is really really really true.<br>Love,<br>Elder Bagley</small></p>

                        <h3>December 31, 2013</h3>
                        <p>Last day of the year. That sounds weird. Today was successful in terms of learning and experience, but the numbers were straight zeros. We had a district meeting and all that, just normal. In the afternoon we started our quest to find less actives from a list of members we have. That brought some interesting experiences. We found 1 less active, and contacted a few others. We went and talked to the most/least atheits guy ever. He starts going off about how God is mean and if there was a God bad things wouldn't happen. But then he tried to use the Bible to beat us. First, we are missionaries who study the Bible; second, you can't say you believe in the Bible, but not God. I kept showing him scriptures where it talks about God, but he just wanted to talk about how God killed the Egyptians in the Red Sea. First time I've met a firm atheist who believes in the Bible. We did see an awesome miracle however. We had knocked some doors, had an appointment fall through, and we were dissappointed. I got the guts to go talk to a family in the street... still nothing. All of the sudden, we heard someone calling for us. We turn, meet this lady from Utah that was in Sucre to see her non-member cousin. We have an appt tomorrow. Lord helped us when we needed it the most. Overall, the day was awful for numbers, but we worked hard and I feel like I learned a lot.<br>->Thankful for the little miracles in life. </p>

                        <p>Wow, it's already 2014. That went by really fast. Today was a lot better than yesterday. We started off with a lesson with Dennys. He's all set and has his interview tomorrow. He's finally there, after like 4 months. After that we went and taught the Utah lady's cousin, Esperanza. I thought it was a stupid name at first, but then I realized that name exists in english, Hope. It was a good lesson, but she is SUPER catholic. I don't know who came up with the idea of saints, but I don't like them very much. Finally, we went with Hno Fredy, Hna Patty, and Oliver to go teach someone that they know. It was a good lesson, and I think she could really progress. She already has a testimony of the priesthood, as a long time ago the missionaries blessed her mom and she was healed. I like when members actually help, it brings a lot more results. Oh yeah, last night at like 2 I woke up super sick. Everything hurt and it was awful. I went back to sleep though, and everything was ok. Today there was a lot of drunk guys. One wanted us to get in his car, another came and said something and when we responded, he just stared at us. He left, but dropped 1 bs of money. We tried to give it back, but he didn't want it. Alcohol is bad.<br>->Thankful for the members of the church<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>Today wasn't too bad actually. Hard time waking up, but I really am trying. That is easily my biggest weakness. The morning was normal. We had companionship inventory where I had to explain to Pinta some of the rules that he needs to get better at. He understood, so no problem. In the afternoon we finally found Fredy the old guy again. He's nice, just a little weird. Later, we went around using our list of members looking for people. We can never actually find anyone that is on the list, but it is useful to contact people. We found this kid named LEonardo, who could possibly be interested. We could find Dina, and it is really starting to worry me as we haven't been able to find her for the last 2 days. We do, however, have Dennys's baptism set for the morning of saturday, so that's good. Finally at night, at Hna Vicky's, we had an interesting lesson. Her daughter is really concerned about evil spirits and stuff. We taught her about it and stuff, and it went well... except for Hna Vicky's friend Ana interrupts every few minutes and is just immature. It's her decision if she doesn't wanna believe our teaching, but she doesn't need to be like a child and whine and stuff when we talk about stuff. That bugs us a lot. Overall, for not being a spectacular day, it wasn't too bad<br>->Thankful for Hna Vicky and her family<br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>Not a real interesting day. The morning was just normal. We finished our weekly planning, so boring... After lunch we had Dennys's baptismal interview, and he passed. Plus, he wants me to baptize him! Wooooo! His mom is still kinda worried, not sure about what, but she is just always worried. After we had a lesson with a new lady, Yascara. She is receptive and curious. Plus, she has a nice house and gave us food. She could really progress. We then went to fill the font. We struggled for a bit, but we got it done. We went to go try and visit Dina, but she wasn't there and it was raining hard. We couldn't find anyone else, so we went to the chapel to teach Karla, but that fell through. Having nothing to do, we went and visited Hna Sandra and Hector. They told us that Dennys's dad might not want the baptism to go through. Well now I'm scared it won't happen. I just gotta hope everything works out I guess.<br>->Thankful that the font works for once<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>BAPTISM!!! I was really scared it wasn't gonna happen. I was praying the whole morning hoping for the baptism to go through. Then I had a voice come to my head that said "It'll all be ok". That gave me a bit more confidence. We got there at 6 to heat the font. On the way down the second time, there was a crazy old guy in the middle of the street pointing out a car crash. He just stood there shouting "TIRAS". It was pretty funny. Then we had the baptism. Everyone showed up late, like normal Bolivians, but it all worked out. I baptized, Pinta confirmed, and then we went to there house and ate salteñas. Most of the youth came too, so that was good. For lunch we ate with the Flia Martinez, where we had chuño... We had 2 lessons the rest of the day. We finally found Dina, and she's doing good. We read the BoM with her and she is curious. Then we taught Cristina again, with Hno Fredy and Hna Patty. She's good too. Doesn't understand perfectly yet, but we'll get there. Overall, not a bad day at all.<br>->Thankful for the obvious, baptism</p>

                        <p>Whew, the first Sunday of 2014, and I just couldn't get up in the morning. I don't know if I was sick or what, but it just didn't happen. Anyways, church was good. Only Karla came, but that is still good. It seemed to take longer today though. We had lunch with Hna. Sandra, Hector, and Maria. It is always good to talk to them, and Sandra is even going to the temple this week. We came home to study, and I crashed. I don't know what my problem is lately with sleeping, but I need to fix it. At night we taught Karla about the scriptures. I am pretty confident she'll get baptized soon. Also, interesting development. It appears that Hector is now dating Helen Martinez, one of the girls in the ward. That should be good, keep him active in the church for sure. At night we ate a small meal with Hna Sandra, and then again with Hna Vicky. Me and Pinta drew pictures of each other that turned out funny. Pinta now always tells Hna Vicky "Que le vaya con la virgen" and that always make us laugh. Anyways, chausits no más, hasta mañadits!<br>->Thankful for the end of a week</p>

                        <p>P-days always go by really fast. Today as a zone, we went to 7 cascadas again. I think it was better this time, except I got really sunburned. This time, me, Elder Long, Elder Harris, Elder Coronado, and Elder Pinta went all the way up. It was super fun. Just pure rock climbing, and no one even got hurt. The pictures are probably awesome from today. Oh, and we also had lunch there, so me and Long made PB and J sandwiches (spelling?) whcih were really good. On the bus ride back, for some reason, me and Long started talking about gun laws, bad idea. He basically almost started yelling at me and insulting me cause I didn't know enough or... I don't even know. I'm just never talking to him about guns again. Other than that, we just had internet, I got a haircut, and we ended with an FHE with Madeline, Magdelina, and their cousin. It was good as well. It was a good day. I just wish I wasn't sunburned. <br>Thankful-> when p-days are fun</p>
