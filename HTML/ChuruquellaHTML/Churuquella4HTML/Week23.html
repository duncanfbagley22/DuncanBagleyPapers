            <h1>Week 23 <small>(January 6, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Dos Mil Catorce</h3>
            <p><small>Happy New Year!<br>It is crazy that it is already 2014. I am in my only full year in
            the mission. New years was uneventful for us. We got home, and ended
            up falling asleep at like 10. We did make scones the next morning
            though, so everyone was happy. This week brought something good...
            Like Dennys´s baptism! It was great. We had to show up to church at 6
            to fill and heat the font in time. However, everything worked out and
            we even had all the youth of the ward there, so that helped. We also
            had breakfast at his house after. We werent sure that the baptism was
            going to go through, as his mom is just a little weird, and his real
            dad was here for the first time in 3 years from Brazil, and we werent
            sure about him. When I was praying that morning though, a voice told
            me everything would be ok, so that calmed me down a bit. Everything
            worked, I baptized him and Pinta confirmed him. It was awesome. Today
            we went to the 7 cascadas (waterfalls) again and this time we climbed
            more. Some people even fell all the way in the water, but not me and
            Pinta, cause we are awesome. There´ll be some good pictures of that
            eventually, when the other elders pass them to me. As for the other
            investigators, only Karla is progressing. She´ll be baptized the 25th,
            and I am pretty confident itll happen. She has a testimony and support
            of the ward and everything. Dina for some reason didnt come to church
            yesterday. She is still House Hunting Bolivia, and sometimes that
            takes times away. We will figure it out though. We met some other cool
            people this week. Hno Fredy (Oliver´s dad) gave us a reference of
            someone that used to come to church, but stopped cause they moved. Her
            name is Cristina and her daughter Estrellita Divina (Divine little
            star? Bolivians are weird). Anyways, the only hard part is getting her
            to understand everything. We had to invite her to pray like 4 times
            cause she didnt understand the question. We also met Yascara (why cant
            they have normal names). She is really curious. She also has a nice
            house and makes good food. The BoM sparked her interest. Other than
            that, we have a few good people, but everyone is traveling, which
            makes it hard. It is weird that this could be my last week. This is
            the only area I have ever known. We will find out Sunday whats up. I
            am excited to see what happens. Love you guys, and hope everything
            keeps going well. Church is really really really true.<br>Love,<br>Elder Bagley</small></p>
