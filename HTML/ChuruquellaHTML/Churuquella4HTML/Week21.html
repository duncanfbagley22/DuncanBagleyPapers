            <h1>Week 21 <small>(December 23, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>1/4</h3>
            <p><small>My dearest family<br>
            This was an interesting week. First of all, merry christmas in 2
            days. It is really weird to be having my first christmas away from
            home. Me and the other elders in my apartment have already decided we
            will put our presents under the tree and open them christmas morning.
            I dont think elder pinta knows he is getting anything, so we will see
            what happens. I am gonna go day by day explaining the week, then I
            will say something about our investigators.<br>Monday-<br>
            Had two FHEs fall through, but we found some things to do at night.
        <br>Tuesday-<br>Kinda boring. In the district meeting I said something and I
        thought it sounded profound. We shouldn`t act like missionaries, we
        need to be missionaries.<br>Wednesday-<br>I went on an intercambio with Elder Long. Me, him, and
        Elder Harris are like best friends here, so it was fun having all 3 of
        us in the house. My spanish is better than elder long`s, but he is
        just so full of energy that it doesnt matter. We had a really fun day.<br>Thursday-<br> Cant really remember, so it probably isnt too important
    Friday-<br>Friday had an interesting experience. We were preparing
    for our ward christmas party, and Elder Long`s comp was sitting there
    joking about how he thinks the rules arent important and stuff. He is
    SUPER immature and stuff. Well, we tried talking to him nicely about
    how the rules matter, but he wouldnt listen, so that kinda pushed a
    button and I gave him a piece of my mind saying that we didnt come
    here to play and this and that. Well, after that he wouldnt talk to me
    for a day and a half. I apologize, even though I was 100% right, but
    it is all good now. Also that day, we were walking around and some
    stupid mechanics shouted ``americano tonto y diablo sonso`` which
    means stupid american and stupid devil. It was hard not to react, but
    we did good.<br>Saturday-<br>We had the ward christmas party. The youth acted the birth of
    Christ, the primary children sang, and the missionaries and ward
    mission leader did the BoM events from the birth of Christ. I was
    Samuel the lamanite. We also had 10 people show up that were
    investigators, and I ate like 12 scones.<br>Sunday-<br>Best things on sunday... I had to chase a dog out of the chapel,
    which only happens in Bolivia. At night, the missionaries of our zone
    sang christmas hymns in the park. It was really cool.<br>As far as investigators go, still 3 solid ones.
    <br>Dennys- he came to the christmas party (actually he was part of it
    acting in the youth part). He told me he will for sure get baptized
    before I leave, so that is good. His date is the 4th
    <br>Dina- She is a little old lady that is the only Bolivian that has
    a thing for time. She is always at her appointments on time. She just
    needs to know the church is true, not that it is just a neet little
    church
    <br>Karla- She knows it is true and reads and believes everything. She
    is just scared to talk to her super catholic dad about it. She has
    accepted baptism, just needs to talk to her family.
    <br>Overall, kinda a slow week. Tuesday I realized I didnt have my camera,
    put I got it on friday as I had left it at Dennys`s house. I am
    excited for Christmas, and we are looking around the entire city
    looking for the best place to use skype. Merry Christmas to all, and I
    have 6 months!<br>Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <h3>December 17, 2013</h3>
                      <p>Today wasn't too exciting. We had district meeting, where E' Diazgranados asked why we thought the district wasn't doing well. When me and E' Long suggested obedience, he just worked his way around that idea. He's kinda a hypocrite. I said something that impacted myself, maybe not anyone else, but at least myself. It was that a lot of time we act like are missionaries, but we're not being missionaries. Later we had a lesson with Ruth. She's good, but she is always travelling, so that doesn't help. We then contacted at doors and stuff. It's not really effective. We had a lesson with Dennys. I think we got him. His date is the 4th of January. He said that if we get an emergency transfer somehow, I can call him and he'll get baptized that night. Good stuff. Then just a boring coordination meeting. We're on intercambios tonight, so I'm with Elder Long. Nothing else really interesting about today.<br>->I'm thankful for members that give us lunch when we can't find anywhere else. (Hno Fredy's family)</p>

                    <p>Well... now I can't find my camera. I swear I have the worst luck. It's gotta be around here somewhere, I just don't know where. I'm still pretty bummed, and it won't be fun if I can't find it. We had service with the Flia Espejo in the morning. We just moved some rocks and stuff. We were talking before, I made a joke about Columbia (wasn't really even a joke, and Montaño said it first) and then because of that Diazgranados made a joke about me missing my camera. I freaked out a little bit, but then calmed down and I was just in a bad mood the rest of the morning. I'm doing better now. We had 2 lessons today. First, we taught Dina. She's great. The owners are trying to throw her out, so her life is kinda tough right now. We put a date for her, and we'll find out friday if she accepts. We also taught Karla the Law of Chastity. It was a little chopi, but it was good enough. Overall, kind of a stupid day. I finished 6 months though, so that is something good at least.<br>->I'm thankful that I can speak English</p>

                    <p>Well I forgot to write in my journal yesterday. There was some interesting stuff that happened. Firstly, we've been pretty unsuccessful lately. Yesterday, we had to go to the cemetary, for an appt that didn't happen. Then we went to print invitations for the ward Christmas Party. We went to the chapel to cut the invitations with E' Long and E' Diazgranados. We were talking just about Christmas and stuff, and Diazgranados was just saying how the rules didn't really matter and that he was just going to do what he wanted. That bothered me just enough so that I flipped out a little at him. Just enough that it made him mad at me and Long for the next 2 days. I just said he should grow up, start acting like an example, and stop messing around with the mission. I meant everything I said, just I probably could've said it a bit nicer. Other than that, we knocked the door of someone who seemed pretty good, and contacted a reference that was pretty good. Oh ya, we knocked a door; a guy answered, looked at us, told "no you pieces of $#@t_?!! One of the funnier experiences. Oh, and I also found my camera, or Dennys found it at his house. Success is small now, but I'm happy.<br>->Thankful I found my camera</p>

                    <p>Well today just wasn't very exciting. We went to an appt, but it fell through. It stinks, cause it was gonna be a good appt. Then we went to the stake to practice singing. Nobody is really any good at singing, so I had to take over a tiny bit. We then went to study at home. We had one lesson, with Dina. She is still good, but just doesn't always read. Her life is pretty tough right now, but if she would just read and stuff her life would get better. After that we went to the chapel to practice for our act for the ward Christmas party. I also went outside to play basketball with some members. I did pretty well, especially because I was in church clothes. Overall, boring day, but I don't feel like we really did any time wasting, so that's good.<br>->Thankful for basketball<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <h3>December 21, 2013</h3>
                    <p>Today was actually pretty fun. We had a few goods happen. First, we finished lunch early, so it gave us another hour to work. We went and contacted some random people and got a new investigator out of it. Then we went to Hno Fredy's house to teach his brother Javier. Just as we finished teaching Javier, Hna Wilma and her family came, so then we just taught them. We then showed up late to an appointment, and he wasn't there. We talked to this girl that lived at the same house, but she didn't have too many clothes on... so we left quickly. Also, some stupid mechanics called us "diablo sonso" and "americano tonto" so that annoyed me, but we didn't react. Then we had the ward Christmas party. It was raining really hard, but still a lot of people came. It was really fun, we as missionaries acted the part of the Book of Mormon that lines up with the birth of Christ, but we did it in a funny way. I was Samuel the Lamanite. There was a bunch of scones, and we even had 10 investigators come. It was a fun experience, and hopefully it will help down the road<br>->Thankful for scones</p>

                    <p>Some days are good, and some aren't as good. Today was "eh..." at best. Nobody came to church as far as investigators. There was a stupid annoying dog that came in, but that doesn't count. I had to give a class, for which I prepared absolutely nothing, but it wasn't too bad. After church provided some interesting experiences. First off I hung out with Oliver Aguirre. I told him he was gonna come with the missionaries, so then he went around telling everyone he was coming with us as Elder Oliver. Then I was sitting talking to some members, and some member (Patty) comes up and says she wants to tell me something. Then in English she said "I like you eyes". Well, I just thank you and left quickly as it made me feel awkward. After church, just 2 lessons. First with Hector's grandma. We talked about the Book of Mormon, but she is very closed. Then we taught Karla. We taught the Word of Wisdom and she believes everything. We just need a push towards baptism. At night, as missionaries, we sang Christmas songs at a park. It was pretty fun and the atmosphere was Christmas-y. Overall, I'm ready for the week of Christmas.<br>->Thankful that they still celebrate Christmas on this side of the world.</p>

                    <p>Last P-day before Christmas. It was kinda boring, but we accomplished the most important thing. We have a place for Skype on Christmas. We're gonna do it in the stake center. Hopefully, it works out well. That was basically everything today. I also called my family to set up the time. I think I used too much time, but I'll work so that doesn't happen again. There were great. It was really unreal to talk to them. My mom cried, which was expected. At night, we had a FHE with the Flia Martinez. We talked about being grateful for the gospel and serving others. It was a pretty good FHE. They are a good family. Tomorrow is Christmas Eve, it's getting really close. 26 Hours!<br>->Thankful for the gospel of Jesus Christ</p>
