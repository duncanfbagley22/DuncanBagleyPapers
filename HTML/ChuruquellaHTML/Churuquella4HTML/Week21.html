            <h1>Week 21 <small>(December 23, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>1/4</h3>
            <p><small>My dearest family<br>
            This was an interesting week. First of all, merry christmas in 2
            days. It is really weird to be having my first christmas away from
            home. Me and the other elders in my apartment have already decided we
            will put our presents under the tree and open them christmas morning.
            I dont think elder pinta knows he is getting anything, so we will see
            what happens. I am gonna go day by day explaining the week, then I
            will say something about our investigators.<br>Monday-<br>
            Had two FHEs fall through, but we found some things to do at night.
        <br>Tuesday-<br>Kinda boring. In the district meeting I said something and I
        thought it sounded profound. We shouldn`t act like missionaries, we
        need to be missionaries.<br>Wednesday-<br>I went on an intercambio with Elder Long. Me, him, and
        Elder Harris are like best friends here, so it was fun having all 3 of
        us in the house. My spanish is better than elder long`s, but he is
        just so full of energy that it doesnt matter. We had a really fun day.<br>Thursday-<br> Cant really remember, so it probably isnt too important
    Friday-<br>Friday had an interesting experience. We were preparing
    for our ward christmas party, and Elder Long`s comp was sitting there
    joking about how he thinks the rules arent important and stuff. He is
    SUPER immature and stuff. Well, we tried talking to him nicely about
    how the rules matter, but he wouldnt listen, so that kinda pushed a
    button and I gave him a piece of my mind saying that we didnt come
    here to play and this and that. Well, after that he wouldnt talk to me
    for a day and a half. I apologize, even though I was 100% right, but
    it is all good now. Also that day, we were walking around and some
    stupid mechanics shouted ``americano tonto y diablo sonso`` which
    means stupid american and stupid devil. It was hard not to react, but
    we did good.<br>Saturday-<br>We had the ward christmas party. The youth acted the birth of
    Christ, the primary children sang, and the missionaries and ward
    mission leader did the BoM events from the birth of Christ. I was
    Samuel the lamanite. We also had 10 people show up that were
    investigators, and I ate like 12 scones.<br>Sunday-<br>Best things on sunday... I had to chase a dog out of the chapel,
    which only happens in Bolivia. At night, the missionaries of our zone
    sang christmas hymns in the park. It was really cool.<br>As far as investigators go, still 3 solid ones.
    <br>Dennys- he came to the christmas party (actually he was part of it
    acting in the youth part). He told me he will for sure get baptized
    before I leave, so that is good. His date is the 4th
    <br>Dina- She is a little old lady that is the only Bolivian that has
    a thing for time. She is always at her appointments on time. She just
    needs to know the church is true, not that it is just a neet little
    church
    <br>Karla- She knows it is true and reads and believes everything. She
    is just scared to talk to her super catholic dad about it. She has
    accepted baptism, just needs to talk to her family.
    <br>Overall, kinda a slow week. Tuesday I realized I didnt have my camera,
    put I got it on friday as I had left it at Dennys`s house. I am
    excited for Christmas, and we are looking around the entire city
    looking for the best place to use skype. Merry Christmas to all, and I
    have 6 months!<br>Elder Bagley</small></p>
