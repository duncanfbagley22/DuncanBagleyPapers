            <h1>Week 20 <small>(December 16, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>Solo voy a escribir el título en español para mostrar que puedo hablar, también no tengo una idea creativa por mi título</h3>
            <p><small>Maimantajamunki Familia,<br>That is quechua for where are you from. I just wanted to show off
            my quechua skills. This week was pretty good. Our numbers didnt fall
            too much, even though we had no time to work on friday, and other
            annoying things we had to do during the week. We are starting to grow
            some success. Me and Elder Pinta and doing great. His english isnt
            awful, and he talks slow for a Colombian. The interesting things that
            happened this week... First I guess I will talk about our good 3
            investigators. First off is Dennys. He went to youth conference this
            week, so hopefully that helped. We have an appointment this tuesday,
            so the date will be set then. He is also gonna help with the ward
            christmas party. I feel confident, but you never know what can happen.
            Second we have Dina. She is super cool. She is an old catholic lady,
            but one of the few nice ones. Really, catholic ladies arent very nice
            here. She has been to church twice, and we even pulled a little string
            in the ward that will help, she is now gonna start working for the
            relief society president in the house, so we have literally done
            everything. She doesnt have a date... yet, but she will on wednesday.
            Finally, we have Karla. She is the ´´friend´´ of our YMs president.
            She technically lives in a different ward, but since she knows
            everyone here now and the elders over there arent too great, she is
            ours. I put a date last wednesday, but it scared her. But but but, she
            read 2 Ne 31 and prayed and now she feels good about baptism. She just
            needs her dad to be ok with it. It is literally impossible to have an
            easy baptism. Send as many prayers this way to get her dad to soften
            his heart to accept the baptism. Other than that we had interviews and
            a zone conference this week. President Dyer is just so cool. He makes
            me feel good and realize what I need to do at the same time. He also
            spoke in conference, along with Hna Dyer the assistants and some other
            missionaries. It was really good, and they also gave us christmas
            presents. Oh yeah, the package came and some letters from Edie and
            Bishop. At the conference there was a push up contest, and president
            was included. He is kinda old, but still can crank out push ups. Other
            than that, just regular stuff this week. We played a lot of futsal
            today. I put on some shoes I found in the house. Bad idea, they are
            size 10 1/2, a bit too small. Life is going good. I feel good about
            the work I have done here. I´m not perfect, but I am growing every
            day. I am about a 4th of the way done, and that is crazy. I am gonna
            blink and it is gonna end. Overall, life is good. Really sad about
            Craig, but I have no doubt he is in a better place. Plan of Salvation
            is real. Love you all, and it is exciting that in 9 DAYS we get to
            talk. Still havent heard anything. Pretty sure it will be skype, so
            dont worry. We will have all the info by next week. El evangelio es
            super verdadero.<br><br>Les amo,<br>Elder Bagley</small></p>

                    <h3>December 10, 2013</h3>
                    <p>We woke up today to some super powerful rain. It was carrying bricks and stones down the street. We had our district meeting and I got to be an investigator. I'd be a hard investigator. We had 3 lessons today. We knocked a bunch of doors, only one girl listened. We'll see, you never know. We also taught Gorki. He'll be baptized, he just wants to travel to Santa Cruz for a month and a half, so he has a baptism date for Feb 8th. Finally, we taught this guy Mario. We'd been rushing into things. I finally just asked if he even believed in God and the bible, or if it was just custom. It's just custom. At least we found out why he isn't praying. We also found this Dutch guy. At the door he said he wasn't interested, but we've gotten better. Now we turn a flat out denial into at least giving out a pamplet. We are progressing. We have the least amount of time in the mission, for the district but we have the best numbers. OVerall, the day wasn't great, but it could've been worse.</p>

                    <p>It was really cold today, fun fact. We accomplished a lot today I think. First off, we met 2 new investigators. First was Claudia. Not super interested, but not awful. Then we met a teenager named Yessica. She had lots of questions, and I feel like she could progress. We also talked to a raondom lady named Fatima. She turned out to be related to the Flia Guereca, proving that everyone who lives here is a Guereca or a Ledo. We then talked to Priyanka and Micaela LEon. Not super interested, but they're still nice. At night, after having deep doctrinal talks with Pinta, we talked to Karla. She received witness that the BoM is true, so that's really good. I botched the baptismal challenge, but we got through it and got a firm maybe. OVerall, not a super exciting day, but it felt successful.</p>

                    <p>Wow, it was cold again. It won't snow, but at least it'll be cold like it is in Utah at Christmas. Today was pretty good I guess. It's hard to contact when it's cold, cause no one is outside. We did have a little success though. First we knocked a door and talked to a lady named Jacqueline. Super nice and listened. Only problem is that she had a supe high voice and it was hard to take her seriously. She also goes to a Yoga Church, first time I've heard of that. Then as we were walking down the street, we saw a lady struggling to take down a sign. We offered to help, and now we have an appointment tomorrow. Hopefully it's good, it's a Preach My Gospel type story. Finally we were walking down the street and there were guys working. I head one whisper "Hey, we'll listen to a lesson if they help us work. That whipped me around and we started talking. We taught a guy named Mario. Basically all he did was bag on Bolivia. Anyways, we had a lesson. Not super interested, but a nice guy. They we had our interviews with Pres. Dyer. He is awesome. The change I've made between now and the last interview is huge. I can lead now, I know what I wanna do, it is just super different. Then we had a practice for the musical number we are gonna do for the conference. For some reason, I'm in charge of directing. I had a lot fun with it. I was going all out to direct as a joke, but it was super funny. Overall, today was pretty good. A lot of memorable things.</p>

                    <h3>December 13, 2013</h3>
                    <p>Conference day! It's been about 4 months since my last big zone conference, and I've changed a lot. We learned a lot today. I learned my teaching is worthless if I don't have the spirit. Also, I need to work of my "attributes of Christ" just overall. Finally, I need to be more grateful for everything and show it more. We did our musical number Joy to the World, which for some reason I directed. It's weird cause now I'm like the oldest (most time in Sucre). Everyone I know is gone now. There's just a bunch of new guys. We had some fun activities. We wrapped each other up in toilet paper, and then there was a push-up contest which included Pres. Dyer. There conferences are always super uplifting, and being with other missionaries makes you realize that other people experience the same challenges. Then we just went to CAmila's 8th B-day party. Ruth was there, apparently saying she's thinking about being mormon! Challenge of Hna Dyer: Record something I'm grateful for. -> My great comp Elder Pinta</p>

                    <h3>December 14, 2013</h3>
                    <p>Well, today was interesting. We started out with 2 appts falling through. We did see people pushing garbage bags that were about 6ft in diameter down a hill, which was funny. We also got blessed by seeing a lady who needed help carrying a piece of furniture up a hill, so we had the opportunity to help. We have an appt. tomorrow. We also met a lady that didn't like how we walk 2 by 2. No problem with the message, just that we walk 2 by 2... Bolivians are weird. Later we went to help Elder Long make an announcement for the Christmas Party. We cut out letters, and Pinta arranged them to spell "I hate you". I like my comp. We ate lunch with the Flia. Plaza. I was doing bench presses using Joel and Gabriel. Then Joel used my legs as a slide. After studying, we went to go print the ward party invitations. It's hard to find a place to print, and when you do, it is chopi. We had 3 lessons. First, with Dina. She's great. Just unexplainably great. She likes the church, and I think she could be baptized. Later we taught Wara, a teenager. She listened and is pretty nice. Finally we taught the Flia Paneagua. He's less active, but still is a good mormon and I really felt the spirit in the lesson. He's incharge of all the money for the supreme court in Bolivia. Earlier in the night, we went to an appt that fell through. There was 4 dogs around us barking. Then we went to knock a door at the other side of the house, where a mean dog lives. Pinta knocked on the door, and the dog put it's mouth through the whole in the door and almost bit off Pinta's finger; we basically ran away in fear. Overall, very, interesting day.<br>->Thankful for the fact that I have good health.</p>

                    <h3>December 15, 2013</h3>
                    <p>A very quick Sunday. We had 3 1/2 people at church. We went and picked up Dina, Karla came with Harold, Hna Estela came (she still counts as she isn't baptized), and Dennys showed up late. After church, we had lunch with Hna Sandra, Hector, and Maria. They're still great. They even gave talks at church. I might only have 1 baptism, but he's a really good one. Ltaer, after climbing to our death, we went to contact a lady we helped on Saturday. She said we couldn't knock on her door, but just shout her name and she'd come. Well that didn't work, so we through rocks at her door, which still didn't work, so we left. We then taught Miguel Gottlieb with the help of Marcelo Guereca. His kinda atheist, but interested. We're just working on getting him to believe in God, then we'll be ok. After we taught Karla. She said she's ready for baptism, but she needs to talk to her parents, which could provide a problem. Freaking Catholics. Then I just watched 17 miracles with Elder Harris at home. The weeks are starting to go really fast, this mission goes faster than you'd think.<br>->Thankful that Hector is still a great member of the church.</p>

                    <p>P-day! Kind of a sad one, just we actually had plans, and the rain ruined them. We were gonna have a futsal tourney, but it was hard to play in the rain. To make things worse, I was wearing shoes I found in the house that were size 10 1/2... I wear a 12. They were soccer shoes, but were kinda chopi, and now my feet hurt. Interest was good and bad. The family is doing well. Mom is busy and stuff, all is good. I did get bad news. My uncle Craig who has been fighting cancer for a year passed away on Saturday. I really like him, so normally I'd be devastated. However, with stronger testimony I have now, I know he is in a better place, and we'll see him again. At night we had 2 FHE's fall through, but we saved it talking to Hna Patty. We are also gonna have lunch tomorrow, something we were sure about. Well, I'm ready to destroy this week. It's gonna be good.<br>->Thankful for shoes that fit.</p>
