            <h1>Week 20 <small>(December 16, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>Solo voy a escribir el título en español para mostrar que puedo hablar, también no tengo una idea creativa por mi título</h3>
            <p><small>Maimantajamunki Familia,<br>That is quechua for where are you from. I just wanted to show off
            my quechua skills. This week was pretty good. Our numbers didnt fall
            too much, even though we had no time to work on friday, and other
            annoying things we had to do during the week. We are starting to grow
            some success. Me and Elder Pinta and doing great. His english isnt
            awful, and he talks slow for a Colombian. The interesting things that
            happened this week... First I guess I will talk about our good 3
            investigators. First off is Dennys. He went to youth conference this
            week, so hopefully that helped. We have an appointment this tuesday,
            so the date will be set then. He is also gonna help with the ward
            christmas party. I feel confident, but you never know what can happen.
            Second we have Dina. She is super cool. She is an old catholic lady,
            but one of the few nice ones. Really, catholic ladies arent very nice
            here. She has been to church twice, and we even pulled a little string
            in the ward that will help, she is now gonna start working for the
            relief society president in the house, so we have literally done
            everything. She doesnt have a date... yet, but she will on wednesday.
            Finally, we have Karla. She is the ´´friend´´ of our YMs president.
            She technically lives in a different ward, but since she knows
            everyone here now and the elders over there arent too great, she is
            ours. I put a date last wednesday, but it scared her. But but but, she
            read 2 Ne 31 and prayed and now she feels good about baptism. She just
            needs her dad to be ok with it. It is literally impossible to have an
            easy baptism. Send as many prayers this way to get her dad to soften
            his heart to accept the baptism. Other than that we had interviews and
            a zone conference this week. President Dyer is just so cool. He makes
            me feel good and realize what I need to do at the same time. He also
            spoke in conference, along with Hna Dyer the assistants and some other
            missionaries. It was really good, and they also gave us christmas
            presents. Oh yeah, the package came and some letters from Edie and
            Bishop. At the conference there was a push up contest, and president
            was included. He is kinda old, but still can crank out push ups. Other
            than that, just regular stuff this week. We played a lot of futsal
            today. I put on some shoes I found in the house. Bad idea, they are
            size 10 1/2, a bit too small. Life is going good. I feel good about
            the work I have done here. I´m not perfect, but I am growing every
            day. I am about a 4th of the way done, and that is crazy. I am gonna
            blink and it is gonna end. Overall, life is good. Really sad about
            Craig, but I have no doubt he is in a better place. Plan of Salvation
            is real. Love you all, and it is exciting that in 9 DAYS we get to
            talk. Still havent heard anything. Pretty sure it will be skype, so
            dont worry. We will have all the info by next week. El evangelio es
            super verdadero.<br><br>Les amo,<br>Elder Bagley</small></p>
