            <h1>Week 24 <small>(January 13, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>SURPRISE!!!</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>I am sure you were all expecting me to be writing about my new
            area… and I was too. We got the transfer calls yesterday and… I am
            staying. With Elder Pinta. I will be in Sucre a total of 7 months by
            the end of this cambio. Well, that was quite a big surprise for me.
            Not that I don’t like it here, it is like home for me. It is just that
            being in the same area, with the same people, knocking the same doors
            for 7 months will be a whole lot. It isn’t that the area is dead,
            there are a bunch of people that could progress, and we still have
            Karla and Dina that are doing well. I have very mixed emotions about
            the cambio. From my first 2 cambios (August 1 to October 20) only
            Elder Harris is still in Sucre with me. It is just really strange for
            me. Well, enough venting for me, this week wasn’t half bad. The
            problem right now is that no one is home, everyone is traveling
            everywhere. Karla was gone all week this week, so we didn’t see her. A
            bunch of other people were just ready to get lessons, and then they
            left. It is hard to keep going with all the people we meet, they are
            awesome, and then they just can’t meet for the next 2 weeks. Dennys
            did come to church yesterday, so he isn’t inactive. He is having
            family problems, so we will have to work with that now. We did have
            this cool experience with a guy named Freddy. He is like 70, and has a
            really gruff voice. He is a little odd, but cool. He read the BoM like
            40 years ago, but said just like a book, so it didn’t make a
            difference. We contacted him like 2 months ago, but we just found him
            again. He told us that he read some of the BoM and had a crazy
            powerful experience, but he wont tell us until Thursday. He said he
            needs to become clean… like baptism maybe. We`ll be focusing on him
            this week. I don’t really have much else to say. Maybe some day I will
            leave Sucre, or maybe I am just serving in Mission Sucre. If I am
            still here, that must mean that I should be here for some reason, I
            just really wanna find out what that reason is. Oh ya, this week we
            were sitting outside teaching some guy, and this taxi drove by and
            this drunk lady looked out the window at me and said ``que hermoso``
            which is like ``how handsome``. Ya, she has a point I guess. I wish I
            had some crazy awesome experience for you, but maybe next week. I do
            love being a missionary, and it is crazy that I almost have 7 months.
            Love you all. 2 Nephi 28:24<br>Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <h3>January 7, 2014</h3>
                      <p>Today was pretty lame. Days are always awful when 2 appointments fall through. I don't understand Bolivians. Why can't they just tell us they aren't interested, instead of making us waste time. They just frustrate me sometimes. We had a lesson with Mario today. He's still kinda weird, but we are making slow process, but it is there. Literally everything in the Catholic church is just tradition, so that doesn't help him. He'll eventually decide to figure it out for himself. At the end of the lesson, something weird happened. We were cut off at the end by someone coming into his shop. It was this mentally handicapped lady that lives in Dina's house. She always just shows up at the most random moments. She must follow us... We also went to Johan's baptism. He is Hno Fredy's nephew. It was good, and I hope it can get his dad active again. I gave a talk with 5 min notice, normal missionary stuff. That was about it for the day. Boring.<br>->Thankful that I still have like 75% of my mission left</p>

                    <h3>January 8, 2014</h3>
                    <p>This is a really slow week. Basically everyone we teach is travelling, so it is hard to find people to teach. Today we worked in the morning because we had a morning appointment (which fell through). We walked all the way up the Av. Ejercito Nat'l (road to Rumi Rumi, pretty steep) looking for less active members. We didn't really find anything, except a cool lady named Delia. She is a mom that runs a homeless organization or something. She seemed like someone who could use the gospel. Other than that, nothing really happened until nighttime. We went to talk to Hector, just to talk for a bit, especially about his new girlfriend. We then went to dinner. We ate empanadas, and finished at 8, leaving us 1 hour... but Pinta just played UNO with the kids. I told him we had to leave like 4 times, but that didn't work, so I gave up. I'm tired of being the only one that cares about obedience. I'm not perfect, not close, but I at least care. Oh well, my goal is to be 100% obedient tomorrow.<br>->Thankful for empanadas</p>

                    <p>Today wasn't spectacularly graet, but it wasn't awful. We had a really good lesson with Freddy today. He said he had a really powerful experience with the Book of Mormon, that told him he needs to be cleared... sounds like baptism to me. He is a bit odd, but he's is nice and is looking for God. We also stopped and talked to some nice people. I heard him read my name tag, so I whipped around and started talking to them. The guy almost got baptized earlier, but I think the members bugged him. They're way nice though. We also went and picked up some money from Hna Magdelina (who also gave us ice cream) to give to Dina. We then talked to a less active named Luceth, who should be good, she says she needs to come back to church. Then we talked to another less active, and finished up talking to Hna Vicky about temples. Not a bad day.<br>->Thankful for the temple</p>

                    <h3>January 10, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Well, today just wasn't the day. We started with the zone meeting. We were supposed to have some big change in the mission. Merejildo and Herndon joked like they were changing the length of missions to 2 1/2 years for elders and 2 yrs for Hermanas. We didn't find it that funny. Actually, they just said that the mission needed a change of heart. We need to dedicate ourselves more to the mission. After that, we had lunch, then ended up by Hno Freddy's house. There, we couldn't find investigators, but found other people. First we saw Hno Efrain Plaza, then Eleazar Toco, then some random member from another ward stopped us and gave us cookies and juice (some people are awesome). Then we went a little farther and Daniela Aguirre came running up with ice cream. Finally, Hna Vicky and her family drove by. We saw like all my favorite members, just no one new. We had a good lesson with Dina. She told us it'll take some time for her to change from a Catholic, but I think she knows she should change. We taught just about random stuff. We finished up with our meeting with Rodrigo, the ward mission leader, and dinner with Hna Vicky. Not a great day, but just one of those days that make me realize I'll miss it here.<br>->Thankful for Hna Vicky</p>

                    <h3>January 11, 2014</h3>
                    <p>One of the things I've learned on my mission by now is that we should never teach morning. Basically every time we have an appointment in the morning, it falls through. Me and Pinta told each other that we just never want to do it again, as 2 appointment fell through. First, with a lady named Silvia, who we've taught before, but she just decided to vacation to Santa Cruz without telling us. Then some dude named Herbart. We talked to him a while ago, he seemed interested, so on Friday talked to him and set an appointment, but when we got there he said he had his church and wasn't interested. Frustrating... We went home to plan after that, probably my last one in Sucre. It was good, I feel like I've left this area a lot better than when I got here. We had lunch with Hna Vicky, where we had charke (spelling?) de llama, which is my favorite food here. We then visited the Flia. Plaza, then went with Rodrigo Diaz to go visit one of his friends, Roberto. He's cool, atheist, but cool. Then we visited a less active family as well. Then we walked around for a bit, talked with Miguel Leon, then ended up in the Recoleta. Joel and Gabriel Plaza were there playing soccer, so I joined them. It was super fun. Finally, we just ate dinner. Oh yeah, we were sitting talking to Roberto, and this car of drunk people drove by. The driver yelled "Elders" so we turned and looked. The drunk lady in the back just stared at me and said "Que Hermoso". We had a good laugh. These last few nights we've been playing UNO after planning, with Harris and Montaño. It's pretty fun, we joke a lot and it is just relaxing. Tomorrow is cambios, starting to get anxious.<br>->Thankful for my mission roomates</p>

                    <p>Cambios... or not. We got the cambio calls tonight and I'm staying. Cambio #5 in Churuquella. Pinta is staying too. I was pretty darn surprised. I was already to go, but now I have to do the same thing for 6 more weeks. Yes, I really like this ward and the people here, but it is hard to work in the same area so long. It's gonna take a lot of faith to get through this cambio. Other than that, today was ok. We had 3 people come to church (Dina, Hna EStela, and Miguel Leon). We ate lunch with Klaus, this German guy whose wife is a member. We basically just ate at a restaurant for free. Finally, a lesson with Miguel Gottlieb. Really the only thing I'm thinking about is cambios. Kinda bummed really, but there must be a reason.</p>

                    <p>P-day, even if I have to stay here for 6 more weeks, p-day is still good. We woke up at like 8 today. We went to internet, nothing special. We ate pizza with the zone. Later I just hung around with Long and Harris. We visited some cool places we'd wanted to go to, and just talked. At night, we went to play wally with the Flia Plaza. It was fun, and we met their friends, who we are trying to teach eventually. We also had a FHE with Hna Sandra's family, Kevin, and Dennys. We talked about just general family problems, like kids fighting, not listening, etc. We hopefully settled some problems. Pinta especially helped as he brought the spirit very strong. Overall, I might not be too excited about this cambio, but I'm gonna work my butt off and try to get some success going.</p>
