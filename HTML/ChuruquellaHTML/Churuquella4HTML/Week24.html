            <h1>Week 24 <small>(January 13, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>SURPRISE!!!</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>I am sure you were all expecting me to be writing about my new
            area… and I was too. We got the transfer calls yesterday and… I am
            staying. With Elder Pinta. I will be in Sucre a total of 7 months by
            the end of this cambio. Well, that was quite a big surprise for me.
            Not that I don’t like it here, it is like home for me. It is just that
            being in the same area, with the same people, knocking the same doors
            for 7 months will be a whole lot. It isn’t that the area is dead,
            there are a bunch of people that could progress, and we still have
            Karla and Dina that are doing well. I have very mixed emotions about
            the cambio. From my first 2 cambios (August 1 to October 20) only
            Elder Harris is still in Sucre with me. It is just really strange for
            me. Well, enough venting for me, this week wasn’t half bad. The
            problem right now is that no one is home, everyone is traveling
            everywhere. Karla was gone all week this week, so we didn’t see her. A
            bunch of other people were just ready to get lessons, and then they
            left. It is hard to keep going with all the people we meet, they are
            awesome, and then they just can’t meet for the next 2 weeks. Dennys
            did come to church yesterday, so he isn’t inactive. He is having
            family problems, so we will have to work with that now. We did have
            this cool experience with a guy named Freddy. He is like 70, and has a
            really gruff voice. He is a little odd, but cool. He read the BoM like
            40 years ago, but said just like a book, so it didn’t make a
            difference. We contacted him like 2 months ago, but we just found him
            again. He told us that he read some of the BoM and had a crazy
            powerful experience, but he wont tell us until Thursday. He said he
            needs to become clean… like baptism maybe. We`ll be focusing on him
            this week. I don’t really have much else to say. Maybe some day I will
            leave Sucre, or maybe I am just serving in Mission Sucre. If I am
            still here, that must mean that I should be here for some reason, I
            just really wanna find out what that reason is. Oh ya, this week we
            were sitting outside teaching some guy, and this taxi drove by and
            this drunk lady looked out the window at me and said ``que hermoso``
            which is like ``how handsome``. Ya, she has a point I guess. I wish I
            had some crazy awesome experience for you, but maybe next week. I do
            love being a missionary, and it is crazy that I almost have 7 months.
            Love you all. 2 Nephi 28:24<br>Elder Bagley</small></p>
