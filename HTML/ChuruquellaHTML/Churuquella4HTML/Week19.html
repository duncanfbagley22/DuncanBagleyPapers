            <h1>Week 19 <small>(December 9, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>Bolivia: Mission of Witchcraft and Breastfeeding</h3>
            <p><small>Mi Familia Mia de Mi,<br>
            How are things at home? I caught a glimpse of what home is looking
            like when I watched the Christmas Devotional. Seeing Temple Square
            with all the lights made me tronki. It is all good though. This week
            was a really good week. It went by sooooooooooooooo fast. It was
            weird. So I am sure the title will spark some questions. Here is the
            story. So about a week ago we knocked a door of a Jehovah´s witness.
            Her name is Segundina (Segundo means second, but they made it a name
            in girl form. Bolivia is weird). Anyways, we went back to talk with
            her on Tuesday. She is a little strange, but she does disagree with a
            lot of the JW beliefs, such as they dont believe in miracles or hell,
            things I thought were basic. We talked for a while and then asked
            about her past and her beliefs. She then went on to tell us that she
            used to practice witchcraft. Like WITCHCRAFT witchcraft. Well, that
            surprised us, but then she gave us some fruit (nothing poisonous like
            you would expect from a witch) and we had a good lesson. Then we left
            her house and outside there was just a lady breastfeeding out in the
            open (not actually too strange here). I turned to elder Pinta and said
            only in Bolivia can you talk to a Jehovah´s Witness that used to
            practice witchcraft and then walk outside and see someone
            breastfeeding. The title is a play on words of Hogwarts school of
            witchcraft and wizardry. Anyways, like I said, this week was really
            good. Best thing that happened was that Dennys thinks he is ready to
            be baptized. He had taken a step back, but he is good now. He is going
            to Youth Conference this week, so I think that will help. We have an
            FHE with his family and Hector´s family tonight. We are going to watch
            the Joseph Smith movie. Other than that, we have 2 investigators that
            are doing well. Firstly is a lady named Dina. She is awesome. She
            lives alone and she has lost 2 kids and her mother in the past few
            years. She also is trying to find a place to live cause the owners of
            her house are losers and want to throw her out. That being said, she
            is great. Obviously Catholic, everyone is, but she came to church
            yesterday. She also came to the Relief Society activity on Saturday
            (awesome activity, cause everyone loves the missionaries and they gave
            us a lot of food). She asks great questions and could really progress.
            Finally a girl named Karla, who is a reference from our YMs President.
            We had our first lesson yesterday and she is really curious and
            already knows everyone at church. We have been knocking doors on one
            specific street, because like 80% of the people actually talk to us.
            We also just have random people start talking to us, so that helps. Oh
            ya, yesterday we ate lunch with a lady and her german husband. They
            have a super big house and own a hotel and restaurant. I ate the best
            hot dog I have ever tasted. After lunch, I proceeded to get in my
            first juggling battle with a German in Bolivia. I won, I have more
            talent. Me and Elder Pinta are getting along great. We just laugh all
            the time and he is a stud. I feel like I learn more from him than he
            does from me. Overall, really good week. We have a conference this
            week, so that should be fun. Also I think I am going to baptize our
            pensionista´s daughter, so that should be fun. Hope everything keeps
            going great at home. Just about 2 weeks till Christmas, so see you
            soon.<br><br>Love,<br>Elder Bagley</small></p>
