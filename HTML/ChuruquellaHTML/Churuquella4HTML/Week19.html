            <h1>Week 19 <small>(December 9, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>Bolivia: Mission of Witchcraft and Breastfeeding</h3>
            <p><small>Mi Familia Mia de Mi,<br>
            How are things at home? I caught a glimpse of what home is looking
            like when I watched the Christmas Devotional. Seeing Temple Square
            with all the lights made me tronki. It is all good though. This week
            was a really good week. It went by sooooooooooooooo fast. It was
            weird. So I am sure the title will spark some questions. Here is the
            story. So about a week ago we knocked a door of a Jehovah´s witness.
            Her name is Segundina (Segundo means second, but they made it a name
            in girl form. Bolivia is weird). Anyways, we went back to talk with
            her on Tuesday. She is a little strange, but she does disagree with a
            lot of the JW beliefs, such as they dont believe in miracles or hell,
            things I thought were basic. We talked for a while and then asked
            about her past and her beliefs. She then went on to tell us that she
            used to practice witchcraft. Like WITCHCRAFT witchcraft. Well, that
            surprised us, but then she gave us some fruit (nothing poisonous like
            you would expect from a witch) and we had a good lesson. Then we left
            her house and outside there was just a lady breastfeeding out in the
            open (not actually too strange here). I turned to elder Pinta and said
            only in Bolivia can you talk to a Jehovah´s Witness that used to
            practice witchcraft and then walk outside and see someone
            breastfeeding. The title is a play on words of Hogwarts school of
            witchcraft and wizardry. Anyways, like I said, this week was really
            good. Best thing that happened was that Dennys thinks he is ready to
            be baptized. He had taken a step back, but he is good now. He is going
            to Youth Conference this week, so I think that will help. We have an
            FHE with his family and Hector´s family tonight. We are going to watch
            the Joseph Smith movie. Other than that, we have 2 investigators that
            are doing well. Firstly is a lady named Dina. She is awesome. She
            lives alone and she has lost 2 kids and her mother in the past few
            years. She also is trying to find a place to live cause the owners of
            her house are losers and want to throw her out. That being said, she
            is great. Obviously Catholic, everyone is, but she came to church
            yesterday. She also came to the Relief Society activity on Saturday
            (awesome activity, cause everyone loves the missionaries and they gave
            us a lot of food). She asks great questions and could really progress.
            Finally a girl named Karla, who is a reference from our YMs President.
            We had our first lesson yesterday and she is really curious and
            already knows everyone at church. We have been knocking doors on one
            specific street, because like 80% of the people actually talk to us.
            We also just have random people start talking to us, so that helps. Oh
            ya, yesterday we ate lunch with a lady and her german husband. They
            have a super big house and own a hotel and restaurant. I ate the best
            hot dog I have ever tasted. After lunch, I proceeded to get in my
            first juggling battle with a German in Bolivia. I won, I have more
            talent. Me and Elder Pinta are getting along great. We just laugh all
            the time and he is a stud. I feel like I learn more from him than he
            does from me. Overall, really good week. We have a conference this
            week, so that should be fun. Also I think I am going to baptize our
            pensionista´s daughter, so that should be fun. Hope everything keeps
            going great at home. Just about 2 weeks till Christmas, so see you
            soon.<br><br>Love,<br>Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <p>Today was a very interesting day. I actually did exercises too. We met Harris's comp, Elder Montaño, he is pretty cool. We had a very interesting lesson with a lady named Segundina. She is a pretty nice lady. She is a Jehovah's Witness. She doesn't believe everything about them though. They don't believe in miracles, but she does, and we do. Then she told us something interesting, that she practiced witchcraft before. Different to say the least... Only in Bolivia can you have a lesson with a JW, that used to practice witchcraft, and then leave to the street and see a cholita breastfeeding out in the open. Then we had a lesson with Dina. She is awesome. She asks great questions and likes us. She could really progress. There was also a lady that has mental problems that gave us juice powder. Finally a lesson with Dennys. He's good, but there is just something missing. It is a bit frustrating nothing has come yet, but just with faith that something will come. Overall, I feel like we accomplished a lot today. We might not have had huge numbers, but we accomplished a lot. Life is good, can't complain.<br></p>

                      <p>The mission goes really fast. It's like you blink and a week goes by. I've been in Sucre for over 4 months, I have more time in my area than anyone in my zone. Super fast. Today we had a fun service project with the Flia Diaz, hauling buckets of dirt. The old cholita that lives there for some reason really likes calling me, Long, and Harris "Hermano Choco" and then she laughs. Pretty funny. Today we only had 1 lesson, with Mario. He's a nice guy and likes talking to us, but we need to get his attention somehow. Then we came back and studied, went to dinner, and then went to design invitations (spelling?) for the Christmas party. People really need help learning design. People were telling me to write sentences and big, drawn out things that just don't work. They just wanted basically a paragraph with a picture on the side. They'd have never passed Jr. High. We've got a full day tomorrow, so hopefully it'll turn out well. I'm really grateful that I've gotten Elder Lopez and Elder Pinta for companions. I've never had problems, and it's been a big blessing. 3 weeks till Christmas, woohoo!<br><br></p>

                      <p>Today wasn't too eventful. I worked out again, which is good. I've gotten to be pretty good friends with Elder Harris. We were laughing the whole morning, and then he threw a banana peel at me. We came up with the idea of going tracting for girlfriends when we get back home. Today we had 3 lessons. First we taught Rut. I feel like she could eventually make progress, but we need Hna. Vicky in order for that to happen, and currently she is traveling. We also taught Nancy and Roberto. We just need them to have a strong testimony of the BoM. I bore my testimony on Joseph Smith, and I think we all felt the spirit. Finally a lesson with Daniela, Alison, and their mom. I talked about the real meaning of Christmas and that stuff. They are gonna move though, so that stinks. Worse thing of the day is that I am now missing chocolate and money. Somebody's robbed me, I just have no clue who. Kinda makes me mad to say the least. Overall, decent enough day I guess.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                      <p>I'm tired... Missions are hard work, rewarding, but hard. Today was actually pretty good. We had district meeting. Whenever Elder Diazgranados doesn't remember to plan a class, he just has everyone talk about their investigators, so we did that today. Later, we had 2 lunches and I almost exploded. First we ate with Hector and his family for his graduation, and later with the Flia Plaza. I literally almost threw up cause I was so full. We had a good lesson with Dina. She is awesome. She listens, ask questions, and understands. I think she could eventually get baptized. We had a short lesson with Ronald Arias, and then went to talk to Mario. We talked for a bit and then his friend Elisea came in and we talked for a bit. Their cool guys, but old guys always like talking. Finally, after meeting a cool agnostic named Marcelo (80% of the people we meet on Calle Padilla listen to us, it is painted with gold, figuratively speaking) we taught Miguel Leon. It is hard teaching him, because he doesn't understand too much. Oh well, everyone matters. Overall, good day, but I'm tired.<br><br><br></p>

                      <p>I like ending the day feeling happy, it makes life better. Today started out with accidentally waking up at 7. Just a month ago, I always got up at 7, but I'm better now. We started with a lesson with Silvia, a lady we contacted in the street. It was a pretty good lesson too. She is super nice and listens. Later we had lunch with the bishop's family. They made fun of me for calling old people "viejos" instead of "mayors". It's Elder Lopez's fault. He taught me that. We had a lesson with Fabiola, decent enough. We went to the Relief Society Exposition (spelling?). Just like normal mormons, they gave us lots of food at the end. Dina was able to come too. Finally at night, we had a lesson with Dina. She is awesome. Hna. Magdelina came with us and even brought a copy of the Liahona for Dina. The family of Magdelina and Madeline are like the only family that helps, but they help a lot. This week went by super fast. Mission speed is so fast now. I'm scared I'll blink and it'll be over. </p>

                      <p>Wow, 2 days in a row that were pretty good. That hasn't happened in a while. We had 3 people at church today. Dennys, Dina, and Karla. I then had to teach a Principios del Evangelio  class, with 15 minutes of preparation. The life of a missionary. We had lunch with the germany guy again. He gave us the best hot dog I've ever eaten. Then I started juggling these golf balls that were there, then the german started juggling, and we went back and forth. My first juggling battle with a german in Bolivia. We then had 2 good lessons. First, we taught Dennys, and he said he's ready for baptism. Finally, I'm not sure what happen, but now his mom is in favor of it. Also, we taught Karla. She is Harold Guereca's friend and I think she'll progress fast. Curious, and already knows a bunch of people in the ward. We then went to the Christmas devotional for a little bit. It made me super tronki when it showed temple square and all the lights. Overall, I'm hoping to keep this streak of good days going, I really like it.</p>

                      <p>P-day... We kind of did something. We went to internet which was good enough. Then we went to the pensionista of Estacion to learn to make salteñas. Well, salteñas take 4 hours to make so we ended up making fried empanadas. They were good, but it was kind of a waste of time. Then I hung out with E' Long for a while (bought 12 bananas and 3 mangos which costed 15bs) and then I bought some pringles. When I got home, I found some interesting things. E' Harris had tipped over all my stuff, including that my desk was in the bathroom. Well plated, so I am looking for revenge. At night we watched the Joseph Smith movie with Dennys, Hector, and thei families. It was as good as ever. It was awkward when Raquel, his mom, took offense when it says that every soul was important. She thinks sinners aren't as important. Also, I always get bothered by people that don't understand that not every church is good. There's only one good one. Overall, good enough day. Ready for the week. </p>
