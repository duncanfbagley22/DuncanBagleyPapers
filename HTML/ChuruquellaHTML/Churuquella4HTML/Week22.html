            <h1>Week 22 <small>(December 30, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>La Primera Navidad</h3>
            <p><small>Sup Family<br>So...where did christmas go? I remember counting the days until
            we were gonna talk, and now it is almost a week later. It was so fast.
            Skype was great. It was great that it actually worked the whole time.
            I did pretty good at time too. There were missionaries that had
            between 2 and 3 hours, so I dont feel too bad. I cant believe I cried,
            that was weird. But... I have now already finished my first christmas
            in the mission, so only one left. Christmas was a lot different here.
            It wasnt as bad as I thought, but it was still super different.
            Christmas eve we just ate, and ate, and ate. Anywhere we went, people
            just wanted to give us food. I probably gained 5 pounds this week. I
            tried really hard to at least keep some traditions. We had my
            christmas tree on the wall, and Elder Harris bought lights that we put
            on. I told everyone we had to leave them on over night on christmas
            eve just like we do at home. Also, in a lesson on Christmas, we read
            the christmas story, just like we would at home. We were talking to
            these people about Christmas, so naturally I said ``we are gonna read
            these scriptures, cause that is what I do at home``. Overall, it was
            probably as good as I couldve hoped for on christmas. Other than that,
            between thursday and friday not much happened. There wasnt many people
            home, which makes it tough to teach people. Saturday was good/awful.
            Between 8-3 it was good, then it just went downhill. So, as I have
            probably mentioned, saturday was Camila`s baptism. For the last 2 and
            a half months, I thought I was gonna do it. But... saturday we got a
            call that was Camila telling Pinta she wanted him to do it. It really
            isnt a big deal, but it broke my spirits a little. With that, all the
            bad thoughts started coming. Whats the point of working and trying to
            obey the rules when everyone else gets the benefits? When is it my
            turn? I came home a little bummed. I still went running around
            basically organizing everything in the baptism, but whatever. I dont
            want any glory or anything, just to feel like I have accomplished
            something. Some proof. Sunday was alright I guess. At lunch, me and
            Elder Long just kinda talked about life on the mission. We are both
            just kinda stuck for right now. I think we need a change of scenery.
            We did have 2 good lessons though. We talked to Dennys`s mom about how
            the church is good for him and stuff. She signed the paper for his
            baptism, so we are good to go. Finally we got her on board. Later we
            talked to Karla. She will be baptized, but I think it will be a few
            weeks after I leave. She is still aprehensive and needs to talk to her
            family. Doesnt matter if I am here, as long as it happens. Dina is
            still doing well too. She is still trying to decide on baptism, but I
            think she`ll get there eventually. Today was a good p day. I got to go
            play basketball at the church for an hour and a half with some
            members. Most arent very good, but the ward clerk could probably play
            in a pick up game in the states. I felt really happy after. We also
            road in a truck bed, sorry mom, up to the top of one of the hills
            here. It was fun too. Well, sorry if my letter sounds too sad or
            something. I am still happy, just a little discouraged at times.
            Christmas was awesome, and I am ready for the new year. Love you guys
            so much, and keep up the good work. See you soon.<br>Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <p>I am going to explode. We ate so much today. After study today, we ate lunch at Hno Fredy's house. Not too huge of a lunch, but big enough. Then we went to teach Hno David's brother-in-law. First, we ate like 20 scones, then we taught. He had a lot of questions, but we did well. We were at their house for a long while. Then we went to the Flia Plaza, where we ate more scones. By this point, I was really full. I also got scared half to death by Dennys. There was a miscommunication and I thought he was leaving for a month and a half, but it is just half a week. At night, we ate again with Hna Estela. I couldn't finish the Pecana (special Christmas soup). I felt like I was going to die. I feel weird being away from home on Christmas Eve, but I kept some traditions. I left the Christmas lights on the entire night, just like we do at home. Christmas is a lot different here, but it has the same idea.<br>->Thankful my family is strong in the gospel</p>

                    <p><b>Christmas!!!</b> My first one as a missionary. Wasn't as bad as I thought. We woke up and made scones, that were actually pretty good. Later I opened all my presents. The best one I think, was a calender with pictures of my family. After that we went to Hno Fredy's house. There we talked to him, his family, his brother's family, and his brother's friend. We just talked about Christmas and stuff. Later we visited the Flia Plaza. They fed us lunch too. Then we went to the stake for Skype. It actually worked pretty well. I skyped for about an hour. It was hard to hang up, and when I did I started crying. Then we just hung around in the stake. Christmas was a lot different here, and I was really tronki, but it wasn't as bad as I thought. I miss my family like crazy, but I'm where I'm supposed to be.<br>->Thankful that skype worked well</p>

                    <p>Today wasn't too bad. It was a slow morning, but it was all good. We ate lunch with Hno Fredy's family again. We basically live there now. I'm gonna miss them so much when I have to leave. After that, we went to 2 appts that fell through. We saw a bunch of drunk guys kissing each other... so that was weird. We talked to Sandra and Hector for the first time in a while. They are still as great as ever. We then talked to an investigator named Nelly. She is an old lady, but she is super cool and understands. After that, we went to pick up Dina to go teach at Hna Miriam's house. Hna Miriam helped teach too. Actually, she basically explained the whole BoM and a bunch of other stuff. It was a very long lesson to say the least. Finally, we met the mom of a future investigator. We taught her and she is pretty accepting which is always good. Right now I'm in the house with Pinta, Diazgranados, and Montaño as they have an intercambio. I can't imagine living with 3 latinos all the time. It'd help my spanish, but my obedience would probably go down. Oh well, life goes on.<br>->Thankful for the Book of Mormon</p>

                    <p>Today was just hard physically. There was a point in the day where I just had no energy. Today just wasn't too exciting. We had some appointments in the morning, but they ended up turning into a fallen through appointment and a pretty lame lesson as she wouldn't let us in or come outside, so we had to teach at the door. In the afternoon we just kinda ran around looking for people. We taught 2 lessons that weren't spectacular, but oh well. At night we did have a good lesson with Karla. We've basically taught her everything now, but we're still working on baptism. We also went and helped a family in our ward move their stuff to a different room. It was raining and we had to carry a bunch of furniture down some scary looking stairs, but it was pretty fun. Also, I think a dog bit me, but it was pretty weak, so I'm not sure. Eh... kinda a boring day.<br>->Thankful that I've been healthy so far.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <h3>December 28, 2013</h3>
                    <p>Well I'm gonna be honest. Today sucked. It started out with getting up a little late. Then just the majority of the morning fell apart. We didn't get enough studying in. We did have a lesson with Francisco, this new guy. He was pretty good. Pinta kinda rushed through the lesson, but it was good enough. We had lunch with the Flia Espejo. Then we started taking the long climb home. During that climb is when the day starting getting bad. up until this point, I was feeling pretty good. We got going and Pinta got a call. Camila had called him and wanted him to baptize her, not me. That hit a little hard. I've known her for 5 months. I've been planning on baptizing her for a month and she gave the opportunity to Pinta, who she's known for a month... Nothing against Pinta, or her, it's just I never have any luck. I mean I'm blessed in countless ways, I'm just tired of working hard here and getting nothing. I'm tired of coming in 2nd for everything.
                        If I try out for anything, I almost make it, just not quite. If I like a girl, she ends up with someone who is close to me. I can't even get the easiest baptism ever. My baptism pants have been used 3 times, none of which by me. I've been part of 4 conformations, but I haven't done anything actually. I'm the only one here at least attempting to obey the rules, I bust my butt to make sure everything runs smooth in the ward, house, etc... I feel like I put in like twice the effort of everyone else, but I get half the reward. I don't wanna say I have the hardest life, cause there is a lot worse. I'm just tired of doing everything in vain. People who don't obey anything and hardly try, get success, but I try my best and have hardly anything. It just makes me wonder what's the point. I'm sure I'll find out, I just wonder when... We had the baptism, I played around with a basketball and that's about it. New day tomorrow.<br>->At least <u>He</u> understands

                    <h3>December 29, 2013</h3>
                    <p>Finally, the last sunday of 2013. We had 2 people at church, Karla and Dina, which is normal, but still good. I gave the sunday school class, with about 20 minutes of preparation, but it wasn't too bad. When we got home between church and lunch, I just was so drained of energy that I fell asleep. At lunch I was talking to Elder Long and we both are just going through a rough patch right now. We are working hard, but the success isn't too big right now. I think this area is preparation for later times in my mission. We did get 2 good lessons. We went to talk to Raquel, Dennys's mom, about his baptism. We got everything good now, got the paper signed, and we're ready to go with his baptism. We also taught Karla. She'll 100% get baptized, just a little more time. I was just being selfish, trying to make it happen in my time, but that's not what matters, what matters is the fact that she does get baptized. OVerall, I am super tired. This week drained me.<br>->Thankful for the good moments of a mission.</p>

                    <p>P-day #? I've been here for so long. Times passes fast, but you look and realize that so much has happen. It is weird. Today started good. Elder Harris and I went to play basketball with some members of the ward early in the morning. I was so happy to play. It has been so long. They aren't great, but not SUPER bad either. After basketball, we went up one of the hills in Sucre. Not too bad actually. For a cheap activity, it was fun. There was a good look out of Sucre, and of course a church. We went up in a truck bed, so that was fun too. Later we went to internet, which was kinda boring, nothing too extreme. At night we had FHE with the newer Ledo family. We kinda waited for an hour for the dad to get there, but it ended up pretty good in the end. It is weird that 2013 is almost over. 1 day left. Still a bit unfocused on the work due to the lack of success, but it is getting better.<br>->Thankful for basketball</p>
