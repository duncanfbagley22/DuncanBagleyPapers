            <h1>Week 22 <small>(December 30, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>La Primera Navidad</h3>
            <p><small>Sup Family<br>So...where did christmas go? I remember counting the days until
            we were gonna talk, and now it is almost a week later. It was so fast.
            Skype was great. It was great that it actually worked the whole time.
            I did pretty good at time too. There were missionaries that had
            between 2 and 3 hours, so I dont feel too bad. I cant believe I cried,
            that was weird. But... I have now already finished my first christmas
            in the mission, so only one left. Christmas was a lot different here.
            It wasnt as bad as I thought, but it was still super different.
            Christmas eve we just ate, and ate, and ate. Anywhere we went, people
            just wanted to give us food. I probably gained 5 pounds this week. I
            tried really hard to at least keep some traditions. We had my
            christmas tree on the wall, and Elder Harris bought lights that we put
            on. I told everyone we had to leave them on over night on christmas
            eve just like we do at home. Also, in a lesson on Christmas, we read
            the christmas story, just like we would at home. We were talking to
            these people about Christmas, so naturally I said ``we are gonna read
            these scriptures, cause that is what I do at home``. Overall, it was
            probably as good as I couldve hoped for on christmas. Other than that,
            between thursday and friday not much happened. There wasnt many people
            home, which makes it tough to teach people. Saturday was good/awful.
            Between 8-3 it was good, then it just went downhill. So, as I have
            probably mentioned, saturday was Camila`s baptism. For the last 2 and
            a half months, I thought I was gonna do it. But... saturday we got a
            call that was Camila telling Pinta she wanted him to do it. It really
            isnt a big deal, but it broke my spirits a little. With that, all the
            bad thoughts started coming. Whats the point of working and trying to
            obey the rules when everyone else gets the benefits? When is it my
            turn? I came home a little bummed. I still went running around
            basically organizing everything in the baptism, but whatever. I dont
            want any glory or anything, just to feel like I have accomplished
            something. Some proof. Sunday was alright I guess. At lunch, me and
            Elder Long just kinda talked about life on the mission. We are both
            just kinda stuck for right now. I think we need a change of scenery.
            We did have 2 good lessons though. We talked to Dennys`s mom about how
            the church is good for him and stuff. She signed the paper for his
            baptism, so we are good to go. Finally we got her on board. Later we
            talked to Karla. She will be baptized, but I think it will be a few
            weeks after I leave. She is still aprehensive and needs to talk to her
            family. Doesnt matter if I am here, as long as it happens. Dina is
            still doing well too. She is still trying to decide on baptism, but I
            think she`ll get there eventually. Today was a good p day. I got to go
            play basketball at the church for an hour and a half with some
            members. Most arent very good, but the ward clerk could probably play
            in a pick up game in the states. I felt really happy after. We also
            road in a truck bed, sorry mom, up to the top of one of the hills
            here. It was fun too. Well, sorry if my letter sounds too sad or
            something. I am still happy, just a little discouraged at times.
            Christmas was awesome, and I am ready for the new year. Love you guys
            so much, and keep up the good work. See you soon.<br>Elder Bagley</small></p>
