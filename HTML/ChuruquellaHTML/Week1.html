            <h1>Week 1 <small>(August 5, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>Himainaya Papits</h3>
            <p><small>¡Himainaya means how are you in quechua. And papits is like some weird
bolivian form of papa. Anyways, I am in Sucre Bolivia, the white city,
even though everyone is brown. So ya, I am here for about 3-6 months.
It is a pretty old city, like almost 500 years. Because of this,
there´re a lot of older influences. The buildings are all pretty old
and nearly everything is white. The streets are cobblestone most the
time, but they are also partly made of bone, so ya... I know without a
shadow of a doubt that Sucre is one of the hardest areas for walking.
Literally everyday is like a hike. My companion always says that we
are gonna have legs like Usain Bolt, and I believe him. I live in an
apartment with 3 other missionaries. There´s a family that lives
upstairs. They are basically one of our 3 families at this point. The
conditions arent too bad. We have hot water upstairs and electricity.
I dont have a closet yet though. That´s keeping me a bit dirty. We
have a pensionista and she is awesome. Hma Vicky and her 2 daughters.
I havent had anything weird at her house and she is just super nice.
Her kids are crazy and like it when I speak english. We walk nearly
everywhere here, and we live on the upper part of the city, so my legs
are dead every night. My trainer is Elder Lopez, from Santa Cruz. He
is waiting for his visa for Venezuela. He has only been out 3 months
and he is already a trainer. We are a little different, but he helps
me so much and he is a great teacher. He doesnt speak much english
though. Apparently my spanish is great for a new missionary. That
confuses me because I feel lost half the time. When they speak slow I
pick up most of it, but between latinos I barely hear words. We are in
the Churuquella 2 area. Our ward is great. They all try to help out a
lot and they love the missionaries. We had church yesterday and I got
up and bore my testimony. Scary. I tried my best though. The building
is actually pretty nice though. Half of our area is pretty nice. Not
like rich, but they would be like a poor house in utah. The other half
is super poor. One area, Rumi Rumi (Zumi Zumi) is super poor. The
people are lucky to have electricity. Everyone has a cell phone
though. The weirdest things I have seen and done is eat Chuño,
basically death on a plate, and I saw some wild pigs eating garbage, a
cow also. The people here are great though. They are all so happy all
the time, except for the drunk guys and the rich people. I´m doing
alright. I´m not gonna lie, the mission is hard. It is a culture shock
and I feel out of place. Everyday has gotten better though. I just
keep on trucking. The things that I love is when we actually teach
someone. I feel weird when we teach the old investigators, cause I
dont know them or their story. We have found 2 new groups of
investigators that I feel closer with. The Leon family is a group of 5
that seem prepared. The dad believed everything we said and we have
another lesson with him on thursday. Even the 11 year old son seemed
interested. Another lady Lidia lives in Rumi Rumi, and she is the only
reason I want to go there. The dogs are fun here. I have seen groups
of 3-25 at times. There has only been one time when we were in danger
of being bit, but we just waited it out. As I said, it has been the
hardest 5 days of my life, but I just try to remember the fact that I
have a family and Savior that love me. These 5 days have been the
hardest ones, but my testimony has exploded. There aint no way the
church aint true at this point. I love hearing from you and I now have
90 minutes to write, so write as much as you want. Love you, la
iglesia es verdadera.<br><br>

                      <h3>July 31, 2013</h3>
                      <p>Ok, I'm almost actually a missionary. Today was way different than any other day. Different companion, learned about my future area, lots of Spanish. My brain hurts. We were in a chapel just about all day, even for a concert at night. Felt like the CCM again. Lots of change. My trainer is Elder Lopez from Santa Cruz. He just finished being trained and has only been out 3 months. He seems super nice and cool. He's just chill and complements me a lot. Doesn't know a lot of english, but he is figuring it out. We are going to Sucre tomorrow. Seems like the coolest place ever. Colonial and clean. Our room is supposedly big too. I'm excited. It'll be weird though. I met Elder Kenney, my BYU Roomate Steven Braun's cousin. My emotions have been up and down. At times it is just overwhelming to think about everything, but other times I love it. It's like the CCM over again. Tomorrow is the real deal though. <u>Side Note:</u> me and elder vasquez (blacksquez) were joking about when Elder Vaca ran into the glass door and Elder Risco ran into the microwave. We decided that Osorio wrote about it as "La Caida de Risco" en 2nd Osorio.</p>

                        <p>First day of the worst month. I hate august. Nothing good, besides my parents' marriage happened in august. Anyways, I headed out to the area today. Sucre, outside edge. We have some of the city and 3 pueblitos. Today was my first time experiencing a lot of things. It's 90% spanish now. Apparently mine is good for a greenie. There're wild dogs, cats, chickens, cows, and pigs. Sucre itself is pretty cool. Cobblestone streets and lots of hills. Classier than Lima. One of the pueblitos Rumi Rumi (Zumi Zumi) is poor. A lot of houses barely have electricity. We taught a lesson on the floor of a small shop. I also had my first run in with angry dogs, no me gusta. The people are great. They're shy around me, but they'll warm up. We went to the 2nd counselor's house and talked with his family. Literally ever little kid is adorable. Ultimately though, today was hard. Culture shock, different language, lots of walking... I definitely was pretty depressed at times, but as Elder Eyre said "Happiness is a choice". I just have to realize that I have to be broken down first to be built all the way up.</p><p>Daily Rating: 30/100</p>

                        <p>Well first off, I bought a knew pen. Woohoo go team! Ya... so today was better than yesterday. On a scale of 1-100, yesterday was a 30, today was a 40. To wanna go home early I would need 10 or below, so we are good. Anyways, we had a district and zone meeting today. Both groups are pretty solid. I just feel out of place because everyone knows each other, except for me. It'll get better I hope. I got to meet the bishop today. He's pretty cool. He served in Provo so he speaks a little english. The best part of the day was when we actually taught a lesson. We were looking for one investigator, ended up finding a different one, whose niece or cousin was there too. The niece/cousin (can't remember) is Lidia. We taught her the first lesson. I helped out a lot. When I was talking about Joseph Smith's vision I felt the spirit. I feel better about Lidia because she isn't Elder Boyd (old guy)/Elder Lopez's investigator, she is mine/Elder Lopez's. I can watch all of her progress, so I feel more interested. Overall, today was still long, just a little less long.</p><p>Daily Rating: 40/100</p><br><br>

                        <p>Whew... Missions are hard. I'll be honest, today was the hardest one so far. Around 8ish, if I would've let myself, I could've cried. They church related part of the mission is great. My testimony is stronger than ever. It's the daily life stuff that is hard. I can hardly say my family's names without crying. I don't understand what's going on half the time, I don't know anyone, it's hard. I'd never ever think of going home, but I understand how people decide that. Easily the hardest 3 days of my life. We didn't really have much success either. It's discouraging. We keep having people flake on their appointments. I can't really do much else but testify and pray. It's tough. We just keep going though. The thing that keeps me going is that this is the Lord's work. I'm slowing progressing towards the point where I don't care what happens to me, I just wanna do the work. The progress isn't fun though, but as one European who's name I can't remember, "The ends justify the means" If this is God's work, the blessings for this will be great.</p><p>Daily Rating: 25/100</p><br><br><br><br>

                        <p>Caya Cama means see you tomorrow in Quechua, fun fact. Today was the first sunday in the field. It is definitely different than any other church I've been to, but it's also the same. It's one thing that I am pretty sure I can get used to. However, everyone shows up late and it starts late, every class does. And the pianist isn't professional... It was fast sunday. I got up and bore my testimony in Spanish to people I don't know. Scary to say the least. I don't know why everyone keeps saying I'm so good at spanish, cause 70% of the time I feel lost. After church was solid. We ate lunch the with Ramirez family. I had some chuño, gross potatoes. I liked the family though. We also taught an 80 minute lesson to the Leon family. They seem ready. The dad literally asked all the right questions and believed everything. We have another lesson on thursday with the whole family of 5. I look forward to it. I've realized I'm happy when I'm talking to people, so that's my goal to talk more. I just need relationships. Tomorrow is a much needed P-day.</p><p>50/100</p>

                        <p>(Also, got a haircut, not bad)</p><p>P-day the first. I'm not counting, but there's about 97 left to go out of 104. I'm a bit trunky, thinking of home, but está bien. I definitely needed P-day. It's refreshing. We went to the gym, which was ehhh at best. After we had email. 90min of it. I definitely miss the family. It was hard to look at the pictures without crying. Didn't cry though. Finally got email from non-family members. Josh Bennion from BYU and Becca Flores from SLC. Glad some people actually care. Not that I'm bitter that the girlfriend I had before before the mission, Krista Dalton, hasn't done anything, not bitter at all... After email we watched a parade for Bolivian independence day, August 6th. The central plaza of Sucre is awesome. We met a guy who served here 15 years ago, Gringo. We played futsol after. I felt weird thinking I was playing soccer in Bolivia. I talked with 2 Americans, Elders Meadows and Long. They helped lift my spirits and give me confidence. I also got to relax and speak english for a bit. Finally, we taught a recent member and her daughters, one of which is being bullied cause she has an old phone. Dumb thing to bully about. Through emails and talking with Long and Meadows, I tried to learn and gain a new attitude. I feel like I'm almost at a good place.</p><p>52/100</p>
