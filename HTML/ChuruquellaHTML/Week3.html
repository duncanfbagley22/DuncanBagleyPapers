            <h1>Week 3 <small>(August 19, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>22, like that Taylor Swift Song</h3>
            <p><small>Himainaya Familia Bagley,<br>Well this week was different. The life of a missionary is like a
rollercoaster. Every moment for me is either way up or way down. I try
to get up more, but you know how it goes. Tuesday we had a zone
conference. Everyone from Sucre and Potosí was there. I walked in and
saw elder Christensen, my CCM companion, and we just ran to each other
and had a big hug. It felt like seeing a long lost brother, that I
hadnt seen in 2 weeks. He is in Potosi and it seems harder there. His
Bishop is inactive, it is cold cold cold, and it is Potosi. It made me
grateful for the things that I have here. I felt pretty good
throughout most of the conference. We learned from the Dyers, and the
APs. Hermana Dyer always picks on me cause of the Bagley name. Also
Elder Lopez is like famous in the mission, so everyone knows who we
are. I got sick though from the food, weird cause it was normal food.
I felt like crap until Wednesday afternoon. Better now. Wednesday
night we had a cool experience. The guy that lives above us wrote a
book. It is about how Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, Columbia, and Venezuela
should unite into one country. The book is crap, but he gotta present
it at the Supreme Court, and we got to go to help direct people to
their seats. We were in our suits and stuff. We looked good. The
pictures can tell the story for sure. Thursday I dont remember much or
Friday. We havent had a ton of success here. People either will
listen, but they dont understand what we are saying, or they dont
wanna listen cause theyre rich. We have 2 families that I feel like
could make some progress, but other than that we are just talking to
inactives and recontacting people. It is discouraging to not have
success. 2 cool things I did do spiritually was one day Erica, the
pensionistas daughter, was feeling sick. She asked for a blessing. I
got to annoint the oil... in spanish. Scary, but I did it. Also, I got
4 people to commit to baptism. It really doesnt mean that much here,
cause they are pretty lazy, but it is something to work towards.
Saturday was something else. In the morning we got, had, to do a
service project in the middle of nowhere. Digging and using a pick axe
for 4 hours in the heat. Fun... it was with the zone, so I got to talk
to the ZL, Elder Robertson, for a while. He helped me realize it is
hard for everyone at first. Even ZLs. Just gotta press through.
Saturday night was a dance festival in the stake. 8 wards, 16 dances,
1 winner. The first round of dances was classical dances, from the
culture. It was cool. The costumes were different than I had seen
before. Our ward was my favorite. The Leon family, investigators, came
too, so that was good. Second round was old songs, like the 70s and
80s. There was Thriller, a Greese medley, Boney M, and the Harlem
Shake. Crazy that those songs are still popular here too, even in
English. Our ward did a Boney M or something song. In the end, we won
the whole thing. Elder Lopez was dancing around in a pumpkin suit
cause our ward color was orange. It was awesome to win. Dancing is a
big deal in South America. Our ward here is great. The bishop served
in Provo, so he likes to speak english with me. There is about 40
people that are pretty constant and theyre great. The other some odd
number of people switch off. There are like 5 little guys that like me
and theyre cool. No one plays the piano in church though, so I might
try next week. A dog came into the chapel yesterday, so that was
weird. Over all I am getting a little more adjusted to Bolivia. The
people are awesome, I just cant always express myself how I would want
in spanish. This week could be awesome or not, but I will try to make
it awesome. The title is 22 because at this point I have 2 out of 24
months complete, so just 22 more. I am excited to get out of august,
the worst month, and get going with the mission. The church is still
true. Thats the thing that I can hold constant here is the gospel. I
love answering questions that people have. Thats my favorite part of
teaching. As I was thinking this week, I think too much, I realized
that I like improving things. Every day I try to make my room better.
I also realized that here I am just improving lives of people. People
here, and everywhere, need the gospel. I just need to find a way to
get them open to the Spirit. This is all from Elder Bagley this week.<br>
Hasta lunes...<br>
Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <p>48/100<br><br>Well flippin crud. Today I wanted to die. We had a zone conference today. It was actually pretty good. All Sucre and Potosi were there. That means my CCM companion Elder Christensen was there. I was really glad to see him. Weird we've only been apart for almost 2 weeks. Feels like forever. It's not like we were best friends, but I missed him. We talked for a while. Potosi seems cold and hard to work it. Made me grateful for Sucre. We heard from the assistants, ZLs, and President and Hermana Dyer. The Dyers are the best mission president and wife I could ask for. The meeting went for 9 hours, and at the end my stomach and head hurt and I couldn't feel my feet or hands. I was in pain to say the least. After we tried to track down Hma. Wilma, a recent convert. We only saw her for a bit though. We were with Hmo. Fredy's kids. Oliver and Jared (I think) were holding my hands the whole way. Finally someone likes me. Finally we had a lesson with that family that found us. They "fed" us great food. But, I felt like throwing up, so I didn't eat. I felt bad to look like crap. However, we talked to their friend so we have a new investigator. They're all going to the stake party on Saturday. Good work day, bad health day.</p>

                      <p>54/100<br><br>Well, today started off like yesterday ended. Felt like crap. Didn't eat breakfast, had a tiny bit of soup for lunch. It was awful. On top of that we didn't have too much success. 2 lessons out of 5 scheduled. Just not the best day. We did get one cool experience though. Hmo. Jose, who lives upstairs, not a member (comes to just priesthood, pays tithing... confusing) wrote a book. It's about how he thinks Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Columbia, and Venezuela should become one country. Kind of a crazy idea to say the least. But that's not important, what is is that we got to go with the family to the presentation of the book and help direct people. The presentation was at the Bolivian Supreme Court. Me and Elder Lopez had a lot of fun taking pictures and stuff. REally a once in a mission/lifetime experience. I didn't really understand the spanish cause it was fancy lawyer talk, but I had a good time. Nothing else to say, full day tomorrow.</p>

                      <p>53/100<br><br>I HATE AUGUST! It's by far the worst month. Really, a Thursday in the middle of August might be the longest day of the year, which was today. Anyways, enough whining. There was a couple of interesting things that happened today. First we heard that 200+ people died in Mexico City today. Not sure how, but that's scary. 2nd, on our way to Rumi Rumi we had to stop because a crane was pulling up a car that had fallen into the canyonish area. We didn't see the people, but they either died or are in a coma cause it was like a 50 foot drop off and the car is totalled. We did have some cool stuff. We got 4 people to commit to baptism. Doesn't mean a lot here, but still it's something. Delina, old lady from Rumi Rumi, and 3/5 of the Leon family. 14th of Sept. I'd be fine with at least one actually getting baptized. The only question I imagine is harder is for marriage, cause I asked all 4 and it is scary. I also got to help give a blessing to Erica, in Spanish. I annointed the oil cause she's sick. Scary, but I'm sure I'll be doing that a lot more.</p>

                      <p>71/100<br><br>Ok, finally a moderately good day. Not perfect or anything, but it wasn't dreadful. Not too much happened today though. We went to do service, no one was there. We didn't end up leaving permanently till about 2:45. We taught Marcela in the cute little Bolivian shop. That's my 2nd favorite place to teach. We wanna help her with the business, cause she sells great stuff, she just has 0 publicity. She wouldn't committ to baptism cause she wants to commit to something she knows she'll stay with. Side note. We joke now that I'm from Gringolandia, not super funny, but it's something. We taught Cecilia, a less active. She feels alone, so we told her that coming to church will give her the Holy Ghost with her always. Later we went to Hmo. Fredy's house. I just played with the kids. They actually recognize me now. Lastly we went to teh family whose name I always forget. They weren't there, but we waited 20 min and they showd up. We taught from 8:30-10. They listen, ask questions, give us food... it's great. Claudia the wife, and Jonathan the friend are always super engaged and intrigued. I want more investigators like them. I decided today that I enjoy improving things, house and rooms and such. A mission is just improving people.</p>

                      <p>68/100<br><br>(Clever opening statement) Today was decent. We started out with a tough service project. I thought just moving dirt was hard. Moving dirt and chiselling rock and getting blisters is harder. From 9-1 we did that. I wasn't in the best modd for it, but oh well. After I gotta talk to Elder Robertson, the ZL and only other white Elder, in English. He's been out for a year and he's awesome. He had it hard at the beginning too, so everyone does. I like seeing the older white guys cause they've been through what I'm going through. After service we had a stake dance festival. It was awesome. First they did classical Bolivian dances, costume and all. Definitely a different culture. Some of the investigators were there too so that was good. After the first round, they did dances to English songs between the 40's and today. Twist, Thriller, Greese, Harlem Shake, etc... I enjoyed watching those dances. Watching the bishop disco in an afro is something else. In the end our ward won the competition. Good ending to the nigh. The day was alright even with the service, and I figure I have the best ward I could ask for.</p>

                      <p>66/100<br><br>Sunday #3 in Sucre. The concept of the church is the same wherever you go but there are some things that're different. I like church here, but it makes me miss Utah a lot. We don't have anyone that plays piano, no one ever shows up on time, and it's freezing cold. Doctrine is the same, same spirit, but it's different. Today was ok I guess. I really do like the ward. There's a core group that is solid. The Bishop is cool, he served his mission in Provo so he speaks a little English. Cedano and Muñoz were gonna have a baptism today, but it fell through. Lunch was with this guy, Miguel I think, and it was basically Top Ramen and pasta. Better than the usual rice and potatoes. We talked a lot about his mission in Santa Cruz. We had a mission meeting with the ward mission leader, Rodrigo, which was good. We joked about having a training with the ward members, but calling it everything but training. Then we just helped Hma. Sandra with her teaching stuff. The bad part of the day is that I haven't gone #2 in 5 days and there is blood in my stool. I give it 2 more days, then there's a problem.</p>

                      <p>70/100<br><br>Woohoo, P-day! We started out P-day at the gym. I wasn't really into the working out, so I decided to go to sleep instead. Good choice Elder Bagley! After that we did email. The family sounds good. Griffin is happier now. Rachel is stressed with preparing for school. Mom and Dad are good as always. After that we went to Chicken Kingdom, a KFC type place with the Zones. We had to go home after that cause I have been constipated for like 5 days and now I'm bleeding down there... not fun. After that we just went to the stake and chilled. We had one appointment with Juan Pablo the 1 counselor in the bishopric. He has a nice house, a room with a big TV, lots of movies, and animal pelts. Cool stuff. We had family night with them and he even gave us a reference. Successful FHE. Overall, would've been a really good day without the blood stuff. Hopefully all that gets taken care of. I am officially 2/24 finished. A lot to go, but I've accomplished a lot.</p>
