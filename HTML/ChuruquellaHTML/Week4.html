            <h1>Week 4 <small>(August 26, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>Wish I had something cool to put as the title...</h3>
            <p><small>Como esta mi familia favorita!<br>
    This week didnt necessarily fly by, but it went a lot faster. It
is always that wednesday and thursday are slow, but if I can just make
it through then, it will be an easy week. First off, my spanish is
getting pretty good. I dont wanna be prideful, but I feel like in 2
months I will understand everything. There are times when I find
myself thinking small things in spanish and a lot of the time I dont
need to translate. Problem is I dont have a big vocabulary, so I have
to work on that. I am just gonna go day by day this week cause then I
wont forget anything. Entonces...<br>
Tuesday- tuesday is the district and zone meeting day. I really like
all the people here. All the white elders are awesome and help me out
a lot. We decided this meeting that all the elders in Sucre are gonna
have a talent show, and the entrance fee is members have to bring a
nonmember or less active, or sign up to come help the missionaries
teach. Should be an interesting experience, we dont know what we are
gonna do yet. Tuesday night we went to Hmo Fredy´s house. He is the
2nd counselor and he is awesome. He has his wife patty, and 3 kids.
Daniela the oldest, then fredy, then oliver. The family is kinda like
ours. We teach patty´s sister wilma, a recent convert. Best part is
where they live. They live in a mansion owned by a guy in Santa Cruz.
They just live in the workers house, but we use the mansion. It is
like 120 years old and reminds me of the haunted mansion in
disneyland. If you wanna see it, I think it is a little bit east of
the Recoleta. It is on Av. Ejercito.<br>
Wednesday- went back to Fredy´s house to rake leaves. Like 14 bags
worth for 3 hours. Fun stuff. After that just a regular day, but at 8
we had a lesson with the Leon family, probably our best investigators.
The 3 kids sound like they got their answers. 3 of 5 have committed to
baptism, so we just need to work on the other 2. We all expect a
baptism eventually.<br>
Thursday- Thursday was 4 hours in Rumi Rumi. There is a less active
member that lives 20 minutes walking from Rumi Rumi, so really far.
The problem with that area is that the people are nice, but they dont
really understand. Plus it is really poor and hard to navigate around.
At night we taught the friend of a member. She is not keen on changing
religions, but she listened. I was talking about Joseph Smith and I
felt the spirit pretty strong. We joked around a lot with them and
hopefully we make progress.<br>
Friday- Friday we went back to Rumi Rumi. We talked with Luis
Fernando, a teenager that sounds pretty good for progress. He said he
is having troubles with English and Math in school... 2 things I am
pretty good at. Friday night was back at Fredy´s again to teach Wilma.
I have secret handshakes with Fredy Jr, a high five, knuckles, then
snap. Also with Mauro, the son of Wilma. It is the Fresh Prince
handshake, ask griffin if you dont understand.<br>
Saturday- Saturday was the second part of service at the Espejo house.
Literally moving a mountain. Saturday was also the first day of rain.
I used my hat, gloves, long sleeve, sweater, and jacket. Still cold.
After we finished moving a mountain we had lunch with them. We were
talking about our investigators and mentioned how we had an
appointment with the wife of Atahualpa, or something, at 6. We laughed
cause it is a strange name, but then one of the Espejo daughters said
she knew someone with that name, that sold perfume and had a friend
named Jonathon, all the same stuff as ours. Turns out, same guy.
Problem is... he has a nation wide company that has been stealing
money from people. A few of his employees have been arrested in La Paz
and now there are notices looking for him cause the police are
curious. That is where the daughter recognized him from. Right now he
and his wife are running from the police in Santa Cruz... so that is
minus one investigator for now. Not everyday you teach a criminal.<br>
Sunday- Cold morning. Lopez taught the primary class and I kinda
helped. After church we met with Miguel, a guy that found us one day
and wanted to talk about the bible. We figured he wanted to bible
bash, but no. He is really interested in the life of Christ, but
doesnt have a testimony of it. We invited him to pray and stuff and we
have an appointment on Sunday. Best part, he speaks almost perfect
english, so if I have a problem answering a tough question or
conveying everything, I can use english. He said my spanish is good
for 9 weeks though. Sunday night was the best though. I think I
mentioned Hector before. His mom and sister are recent converts, but
not him. He just hasnt really believed in anything. We met with him
yesterday to ask about his experience praying. He said he felt
something different and he knows there is something more in life. When
Elder Lopez talked about families and his testimony, both him and
Hector started crying. The spirit was super strong. We have a lesson
on wednesday that should be awesome. Definitely the most spiritual
experience thus far. Overall, this week was the best so far. I take
pictures of all your letters and read them throughout the week. I pray
for you all and let Uncle Craig and the ward know that they have
Bolivian prayers every night. Church is true, Bolivia is slowly
getting better, and Elder Bagley will be fluent in spanish in 2 years.
Chau hasta Lunes. Os amo y yo sé sin dudas que la iglesia y el
evangelio de Jesucristo están en la tierra hoy y tenemos la plenitud
de ambos en nuestra iglesia. Paz y amor (that is spanish peace sign)

                      <p>65/100<br><br>I wanna go to sleep really badly right now, but it is my goal to write in my journal 730 times on the mission so I gotta do it. Today was aight. District/Zone meeting. On Sept. 7 we are gonna have a missionary talent show, so that'll be fun. I really like all the missionaries in Sucre. There're 2 zones, but it is basically like one. After that we had 2 lessons that I felt good about. With Marcela and with Neesa (not sure how to spell it). I felt like I contributed sufficiently even with my repetitive spanish. Especially during the lesson with Neesa. I just felt like we should talk about the Book of Mormon, so we did. We will see if that pays off. Later we just went to Hmo. Fredy's house, talked to Wilma, a recent convert, and hung out. An appointment fell through also. Fredy lives in an old huge mansion from the 1880s. It felt like a movie being there. Also, all the little kids that were there like me, so that's fun. We went to Hma Vicky's later where there was a big spider that almost made Erica and Camila cry. Today was ok, bt I just have this feeling that we need more investigators.</p>

                        <p>65/100<br><br>I am confused. 40% of the time I hate life and wonder if I can make it 2 years. 30% of the time I am happy and don't think too far into the future. 20% of the time I am neither happy nor sad, just chuggin on. The last 10% is just I don't know what. I wanna be happy 100% of the time, but it is hard. Today was aight. Service in the morning. Raking leaves and stuff. I wasn't as helpful as I should've been, cause I was feeling sad. We were at Hmo Fredy's house, which part of it is the old mansion house. It's like a movie. After that we talked with a guy from the ward that actually gave us a reference. Lastly we taught 4/5 of the Leon family, not the mom. I feel like we are gonna get somewhere with them. The kids all sound like they got their answers. The son Miguel aka Gorki is like the most spiritual 11 year old I have ever met. I felt good about the lesson, so all is well. Hopefully we can get them to come to church. Today was good, but long. I really am waiting to lose myself in the work so I can be a better missionary. At this point I still think of home a lot and am not 100% here.</p>

                        <p>73/100<br><br>Tiras, that's the word Elder Lopez always uses for tired, which is what I am right now. 3 1/2 hours in Rumi Rumi today. We literally went to the farthest house in our area. 20 minutes walking distance. We had a marginally successful day. We taught Delina, the old cholita from Rumi Rumi. She doesn't understand everything, but she's gonna come to church. We had some other long conversation, like that with Ambar. At least her cute little daughter remembered me. After that we talked to Hma. Sandra about service and stuff. Finally we went to the house of Magdelina and Madelin to teach Madelin's friend. She isn't super duper interested, but the lesson went well. I did a lot more teaching than usual. When I was talking about Joseph Smith I felt the spirit pretty strong. Hopefully we can get her to realize that she needs the gospel. Overall, a decent day. We are gonna write the album Tiras Para Siempre en Rumi Rumi. I'm halfway or more to P-day, so I'm almost at break time.</p>

                        <p>75/100<br><br>Not a very spiritual thought, but I feel like there is a volcano up my butt. Figure I might wanna remember the pain one day and it's a pretty vivid scene. Anyway, today was aight. Lots of time in Rumi Rumi, actually less than yesterday, but 2 hours is a lot for there. We taught Luis Fernando, a teenager that seems interested. I offered to help him with his english and math homework too. After we taught Ambar. Nice family, nice lesson, but the chairs are awful. After that we taught Bolivia (named Bolivia, lives in Bolivia) a less active. After that we went to Hmo. Fredy's house to teach Hma. Wilma. I love both of those families. I have a secret handshake with little Fredy (high five, knuckles, snap) and with Mauro (Fresh Prince handshake). They are all awesome and I enjoy them a lot. Plus, the house is like a 100yr old mansion that is really interesting. Finally we taught Neisa. She seems interested and she really wants to know the truth. I feel like we'll make progress with her. Overall, pretty good day. There're still times I hate, like the morning, but it is getting better being here. Still lots of time to go, but the end is always getting closer.</p>

                        <p>70/100<br><br>Well today was interesting to say the least. We started out back at the Espejo family's house moving the second half of the mountain of dirt. It wasn't as bad this time cause I was mentally prepared. After that we had lunch with them. The second plate was really spicy so I couldn't finish it. We were talking for a bit and Ataualpa and Claudia, the family with the nice house and stuff, came up. One of the Espejo daughters said she saw a notice saying the police are looking for a man with that name. Turns out, same guy. He has a perfume company, and apparently he has been ripping people off and a few of his workers have been arrested, now the police want him. We haven't seen him in weeks cause he's been "travelling" and we called Claudia to cancel our appointment, but she was going to Santa Cruz to "travel". Anyways, probably won't see them for a while. After that we taught the Plaza family, less active. They're great except the grandma Yolanda nevers stops talking and thinks she's something else. Then we talked with Sharon and Stella upstairs. Overall, interesting day. Sad to lose a pretty solid investigator, but I'm glad I'm not in their place.</p>

                        <p>80/100<br>Sunday #10<br>Whew, busy day. Regular church, 0 investigators. Lame, Bolivians are lazy. We taught the 8-11yr old primary class, and by we I mean Lopez, I just sat there watching the normal madness of children. After that we talked to this guy named Miguel. He asked us last week if we could talk about the Bible. We figured he wanted to Bible bash, but no, he is just curious. We talked for a while. He believes in Jesus and is teachings, but isn't sure that he was the son of God, and he only knows that there is a higher power, but he doesn't know what. We taught a lot of stuff, and have another lesson next week. Best part, he speaks english, woo! It'll probably be 90/10 spanish, but at least there's a little english. We had lunch with the bishop and family. Their house is awesome and they are cool people. Then we talked with a less active family. Lopez talked, I played with the little girl. The mom is a member that doesn't believe in the BoM. Not sure how she was baptized... Best part of the day, week even, was Hector. He said he felt peace and stuff and he knows there is something more. Once Lopez starting baring testimony, him and Hector both started crying. Crazy powerful spirit. Hector will be baptized eventually. He still reminds me of Griffin too. Lesson on Wednesday that I'm excited for. P-day tomorrow, woo!</p>

                        <p>80/100<br><br>P-day, el mejor dia. I love p-day cause it is relaxing, I can write the family, we hang out with the zones. It is awesome. This p-day was as good as others. First we went to a pensionista of some of the other elders and ate salteñas for the pensionistas birthday. After that we had email. A lot happened in the last week. Firstly, the family bought a new car... why'd they wait 2 months. A 2013 subaru something. Also, my mom is now YW President. REally didn't see that one coming. She'll be great. Griffin is a senior in high school, Rachel is an actual teacher. Different stuff. After that we had a Ping Pong tournament. I'm definitely not one of the best, but I made it to the semifinals. I lost to Elder Tapia, who is like a robot and one the whole thing. I also talked to Elder Mickle about BYU and then Elder Singer about life in general. I like talking to white guys cause we have relatable backgrounds. Finally, we had FHE with Hma. Yolanda. She is nice, but talks a lot. Elder Lopez showed a cool trick where you can rip a paper just once and have it make a cross. Overall, good day. Ready to have a good week of work.</p>
