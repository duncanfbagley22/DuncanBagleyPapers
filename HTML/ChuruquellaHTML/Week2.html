            <h1>Week 2 <small>(August 12, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>$7.7</h3>
            <p><small>Mi familia amada,<br>
    Sorry that this letter is a little late. We had an adventure this
morning... Anyways, life is a lot better this week than the last. I
was trying to sound happy last week, but I was in a hole. Culture
shock like crazy. I was pretty down. It was tough to read the letters
without crying. Now it is a lot easier. I´m by no means accustomed,
but I am a lot closer. Sucre is starting to feel like home at times.
The food is great on Monday-Friday. Saturday and Sunday is with the
members and it is... different at times. Faux rabbit and such. My
pensionista Hma Vicky is great. The last 3 breakfasts we had scones,
empanadas, and french toast. Her kids actually like me now. I have
made a couple of friends now just cause I speak english and they find
that interesting. For p day today we went to this canyon. On p day we,
the gringos, speak english to each other for a break. I have made
pretty good friends with a few of them, and they have helped me get
through the harder times cause they told me everyone has them. We went
through this cave and then had an interesting photo shoot. We came
back to find our guide, a guy from the stake, had literally sliced
open his foot. Really gross. If that wouldve been a missionary, theyd
be out for a while. We had to wait a while for the bus, so we are late
for email today. We have a zone conference tomorrow, so its kinda like
another p day. Oh, i wrote $7.7 because that is what we use a day, for
everything food living spending. Around 231 dollars a month. Lebron is
making more every minute. I have two cool experiences I wanna share.
Sucre is a hard area cause people either dont really understand what
we are teaching, or they are super super set in their ways. We dont
knock doors, just references. Right now there are around 5ish
investigators that are kinda progressing. Only one came to church, but
thats better than none. Anyways, so there is this new convert named
sandra. She and her little daughter maria are members, but her son
hector isnt. One night we just finished with all our plans. I felt
like we could check up on Sandra. She wasnt home but Hector, 16, was.
We had a solid hour lesson with him. He reminds me of griff a little,
so I felt comfortable with him. I talked more that lesson than ever.
We have another lesson on Thursday, itll be interesting. The other
happened Saturday I think. We were walking through the Recoleta,
basically by where we live, and a car came up next to us and asked
what time the church was. We thought they meant the catholic one, but
he said that he had family members that were mormons. He was baptized,
but his wife isnt a member. We went in their house, nicest one we´ve
been in, and talked for a while. We have an appointment tomorrow with
them. It is crazy to me the ways the Lord puts people in our path. It
strengthens my testimony every time. Other than that we havent had a
lot of success. I will try to answer more questions in your personal
family emails. One thing that got me through one day was thinking of
Easton. That talk we had after my farewell went through my head, and
that I am an example to him and all the other little guys. If I let a
mission get me down, what reason do I have to be an example. I wanna
write more stuff, but I forget what happens when. I had to pray in
english cause this weird girl wanted me too. It was harder than I
thought. There are certain words that are automatic spanish at this
point, Dios, Evangelio, Expiacion, Hermana. It was weird to me. I have
some great pictures to send too. Hopefully this is what people wanna
hear. We walk more than ever. Disneyland seems easy. We live on the
hill, Cerro Curuquella, at the very end of Calle La Paz. Hopefully
life keeps getting better. I read my patriarchel blessing more now and
the scriptures mean more. Me and Elder Lopez get along great. He is a
crazy good example, but not strict. I still havent gotten the package,
but apparently it takes time from La paz-cocha-Sucre. If you wanna see
the kind of places we go to, look up Recoleta, the two big hills in
Sucre, the central plaza of the 25th of may, and poor people of
Bolivia. Anyways, the work is the Lords work and I just try to always
keep going. Love the family more than anything I am always thinking
about you guys. Yo sé, sin dudas que el evangelio de Jesucristo es
nuestro proposito en esta vida. La iglesia es mi paz y gozo en este
momento, y yo sé que El Señor tiene un camino para mi. Entonces, hasta
lunes. Le amo familia. La iglesia es verdadera. ha, spanish
<br>Love,<br>
   The one and only Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <p>Bolivia Independence Day<br><br>I have officially been in Bolivia for a week. 1/6 done with the first transfer. Weird, kinda... Today might have been the best day so far. We started off the day with empanadas, so that's probably what did it. We didn't have too much success today because it's a holiday. We tried to go to Rumi Rumi, but we didn't talk to anyone or find anyone. We helped clean the church. Later we had a solid lesson with Raul, Dayana, and Reyna. Raul and Dayana are ready for baptism, but the mom Reyna hasn't been to church yet, so we are working on her. The lesson was great. We talked about commandments and such. I not only bore a testimony, but I shared a scripture and a personal experience. Best I think I've done. Hope to always improve though. After that we went to the church and talked with the members. They are starting to warm up to me. I played basketball a little and that was fun. Some of the girls started flirting with me and that was a little weird, but at least someone likes me and talks to me. Overall today was pretty good, things are looking better for Elder Bagley in Bolivia. <br><br>65/100<br><br><br><br></p>

                      <p>Daily Rating: 70/100<br><br>Ughhh. Today was physically tough. 2 service projects, a trip to Rumi Rumi and normal everyday Sucre walking. I'm beat. We started off the day about 3ish miles from home, doing service for the Espejo family. We literally moved a mountain down 2 flights of stairs and across the street. 3 hours of moving hundreds and hundreds of buckets of dirt and rock. The family was nice though, but their toilet didn't have a tank or a seat... After that we hit up Rumi Rumi with the ward mission leader Rodrigo. We taught a lesson to Ambar and talked to her family. She's 20 and has 4 kids. Yikes... After that we went to Hma. Vicky's and pealed cardboard for some reason. Finally at 8:30 we went to this creepy house. By creepy I mean in a gully and next door there was a <u>cult</u> meeting going on. We taught Cecilia and she and her sister are gonna listen to us tomorrow. Cecilia is less active and the sister isn't a member. They both want me to teach them English. Today was physically tough, but I just took the 1st service as a metaphor for a mission, that I can't do it all at once,  it's a progress. Also, I kept the idea of my cousin Easton in my mind all day. I talked to him at my farewell for a while, and he looks up to me, and I figured I wouldn't wanna let him down, so I just keep going. That is all.</p>

                      <p>I thought yesterday was tough, but today I physically felt worse. All the shoveling yesterday took a tole on my back. It hurts. Today was supposed to be the great teaching day. We had 3 firm appointments. But we're in Bolivia, so in reality we only had 1/5 of one and 1/2 of another and 0/100 of another. Honestly, I was pretty bummed. I knew all the investigators and I thought we were gonna have a lot of success and get some baptisms. But I guess I need pacience (or patience, can't write english) We went out the Rumi Rumi for about 4 hours. We even went past Rumi Rumi. Literally a 25 minute walk one way to a house, but the family has a brother with cancer and needed comfort. We found 2 new investigators though. One was in Rumi Rumi, the mother-in-law of one of the references. Another was a guy that just happened to be walking by when one of our appointments (pen died) fell through. He was super excited to hear the message and to get a Book of Mormon. He wants to come to church too. It was awesome. I believe he was part of God's plan, and the appointment fell through so we could talk to him. God works in mysterious ways, but what happens is always supposed to happen. <br><br>63/100<br><br><br></p>

                      <p>I know I say this everyday, but I'm most exhausted tonight. Lots of walking and just tough stuff. Today was just... uhhh... We had a zone meeting today. We have to try to get a lot more new investigators. 20 per week. It'll be tough, but we'll try. In terms of success, we did pretty good today. We went to teach Ambar, an investigator in Rumi Rumi, but we found her husband isntead and now he is an investigator. We taught a couple other lessons that were good too. The best part was at the end of the day I felt like we had time to go talk to Sandra, a recent conver. She wasn't there, but we found her son Hector, isn't a member. We were able to talk to him for a while. We've been trying to talk to him for a while, but we finally got to him. I talked a lot in the lesson, cause he reminded me a little of Griffin, 16/17 and confused. We get to go back next week. It was cool to see that I actually had a prompting that worked. Gave me confidence in myself and gave me a lot of faith.<br><br><u>Daily Rating:</u>60/100<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                      <p>So that's why people like their missions. Today was solid. Started out with scones, a sign of a good day. After we had a lesson with Delina, an old lady from Rumi Rumi. She's super happy and gives us food. She likes to talk, but that's ok. She's gonna try to come to church. We had lunch at the Diaz's, without the Diaz's. Just kinda ate by ourselves. Later we had 2 lessons with Brianca Leon and Vania/Raul. Hopefully they can get to church too. The day was decent up to that point, but what happened at 8 was awesome. We were just walking down the street, headed to maybe teach a lesson, when a car pulled up and asked us when church was. We thought they meant the Catholic one, but then the man said they Mormon one, he hasn't gone to church in 20+ years andhis wife isn't a member. We ended up spending an hour at their house and they seem really interested. They're gonna come to church tomorrow and we have another lesson Tuesday. Crazy miracles on the mission. The Lord will put us where he needs us to spread his words to those who're prepared. I hope everyday is like this.<br><br>81/100<br><br><br><br></p>

                      <p>73/100<br><br>Pen switch, mind blown. Anyways, today was Sunday #2. I decided something. When you're in a new place, he first couple days or weeks take a while because all of the time you spend there is the only memories you have of the place, so it feels like you've done so much, when it's really only been a little while. Once you're accustomed (not sure on spelling) you start only remembering important things and discard the unimportant, so it feels like time goes faster. Not sure if that'll make sense to anyone but me, but there's the Elder Bagley theory of time relativity. Anyways, being my 2nd Sunday, it felt shorter. Only 1 investigator, the nice old lady from Rumi Rumi came to church, but 1 is better than none. Other than that the day wasn't too spectacular. I made a friend in Sunday School, a little girl that was super cute. I'm starting to get along with everyone better, as in they recognize me now. I always feel better when I can talk to someone, but that's hard when I'm at like 40% spanish fluency. Oh well, I always just gotta keep going and try to always enjoy myself. 2 Ne 2:25 "Adam fell that men might be, and men are that they might have joy" Gotta enjoy life, no matter what happens.</p>

                      <p>Happy Anniversary Troy and Susan! 24 years of marriage today. Today was p-day, and an interesting one. We went to the stake first. I scored twice in futsal, one backheel goal. Then I dunked the soccer ball in the hoop. Felt pretty good about myself. Then we loaded in vans and went to this far away bridge place. There we went through this little tunnel, hung around and stuff. I was with Elder Meadows, Elder Long, and Elder Weekes most the time. Took some interesting pictures. When we got back we found out our guide, some dude from the stake, sliced open his foot on a rock, like literally sliced open. It was nasty, but Lopez carried him home. After that we had email eventually. Email is good, but I always miss my family after. Oh well, I love them so it's ok. Finally we had FHE with Cedano, Muñoz, and Hma. Miriam's family, and watched the Home Teachers. Overall a pretty solid day. Tomorrow is p-day #2 as we have zone conference nearly all day. Life is getting better, but still have a long ways to go.<br><br>72/100<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
