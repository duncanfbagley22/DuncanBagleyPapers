            <h1>Week 25 <small>(January 20, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>007</h3>
            <p><small>Fammmmmmmmmmmmmmmily,<br>
                Well, I think I did way to much complaining last week about staying
             here. Well, I prayed about it, and got a big ole scriptural slap in
             the face on Tuesday. I read in Jacob 5 that morning, and especially
             verses 27 and 50 hit me hard enough. 27 says "Let us prune it, and dig
             about it, and nourish it a little alonger, that perhaps it may bring
             forth good fruit unto thee" and 50 says "Spare it a little longer". It
             was a good answer to my prayers. On top of that, the Lord showed me
             why I needed to be here this week. We found 8 new investigators,
             pretty good for this area, and they came from all different sources.
             Last saturday I felt the impression to knock a door, but ignored it.
             Well this week I decided to go knock it, even though it had a
             microphone and all that at the door, which usually means they are rich
             and wont answer. Well, we knocked it, and met this kid named Marcelo.
             We had a lesson with him on Saturday and he seems pretty interested.
             We also found this non member wife of a less active. They found the
             mom of this daughter we had taught before. We had 7 lessons fall
             through in 2 days, but that didnt stop us. We had pretty good numbers,
             at least in a week where so many lessons fell through. We found out
             that our district has the best numbers in the zone, and I think maybe
             in Sucre too, and me and Pinta have the highest numbers in the
             district, so we feel pretty good about that. We had to go find a bunch
             of people last week, and this week we are gonna try and get them to
             progress. As far as my companion, we have been together for so long
             that we can finish up each others sentences in lessons and we know
             what each other is gonna do. We met the new comp of Elder Diazgranados
             this week. He is a greenie, elder Bradford from California. He is
             barely 18, so part of the new wave. He has gotten sick like 3 times
             already, but he is a good elder. My new roomate is Elder Cossio from
             Santa Cruz. He speaks really good english, so in the house it is
             basically 80% english now. We went and played futsal with the young
             men today, and it is so different that when I got here. In August, we
             had 3 young men. Today at futsal, we had 10 or so. It is fun to play
             with Dennys and Hector, just knowing that we helped them to get the
             gospel and now it is a big part of their lives. We are going to a
             tropical place later today for p day, so that should be fun. Oh ya, I
             sat with just Oliver during the entire sacrament meeting today, so he
             is basically my best friend in the whole world. I felt good on
             Sunday cause a bunch of people came up to me and were so happy that I
             stayed, I am basically from Sucre at this point. I love you guys so
             much, let me know if you want to know anything about Sucre or Bolivia
             or the mission. I know Sucre about as well as I knew BYU, probably
             better. I finished 7 months this week (hence 007) and it is going
             soooooo fast. To think I am only 5 months away from a year, is kinda
             scary. Talk to ya in a week, abracitos y besitos<br><br>
                Love,<br>
                  Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <p>Well, back to work. Cambio #5 in Sucre. We had to send Elder Montaño this morning, that wasn't fun. I'm really gonna miss him. We also met Harris's new comp, Elder Cossio. We heard a lot of bad things about him, but I actually kinda like him. Other than that, nothing cool really happened. We only had 1 lesson today, with a lady named Frida. Then, we just kinda worked around the area, but we couldn't find anything. Nothing happens here right now, because everyone is in the freaking campo. We can't find doors to knock, cause no one is home to answer. We are working hard, so eventually the results will come. I'm not as discouraged about being here anymore though. I'm supposed to be here, I just need to find out why.</p>

                    <p>Well, this week just hasn't started out as we'd like. First of all, this new comp of Elder Harris concerns us. He seems great, but there's gotta be a reason everyone tells us to be careful. He makes me think of the scripture Jacob 7:4. Anyways, we keep finding possibly good future people, but everyone else flakes out on their lessons. We met this guy named Alfonso today, and he's a philosopher. He's hard to talk to, just cause you have to be smart and he makes you think. I also had the feeling for some time that we should knock this door. I was skeptical at first as it was a big house with a microphone and stuff, but we met a kid named Marcelo that seems pretty good. We had a lesson with Dina as well. She's still great, and wants everything to be true. She's jsut they coolest little old lady. Other than that, nothing much happened today. We are working hard, so I don't feel bad.</p>

                    <p>Today was actually a good day. We studied and what not in the morning. I would've had a perfect morning, but Cossio and Harris take so long to shower, that I had to do it right before lunch. We had some lessons today. First with this lady whose name I can't remember. We basically introduced the BoM and that was it. Later we talked to Mario, this guy that is a tailor. He's cool, but doesn't really listen intently. WE went to a lesson with a less active (which was 1 of 4 lessons that fell through) and talked to her active mom. She like 4'6" and just awesome. She was saying she felt bad for not doing everything she should. We thought it'd be like reading and praying. Nope, she does all that, she just wants to go to the temple more and have FHE. She is an old 80 yr old woman that still comes to church every week by herself. She was a great example to me. We went to talk to Hna Marta, and through talking our way into it, met her inactive son and nonmember wife. Potentially could progress. Overall, not a bad day at all. Some days you just feel good as a missionary.</p>

                    <p>Welp... My alarm didn't go off, so I got up late. We had our meetings today. The district and zone are a lot different now. I've been 3 months longer than anyone here besides Elder harris. We had 3 lessons fall through, making it 7 in 2 days. Eh... Pinta got half bit by a freaking huge dog, so that spiced things up. We had to knock doors and found a few interesting people. We went and visited with Hno Fredy's family as well. They are not sure if they will be staying in their house or not, as the government now owns it. They will find out soon. I really hope they stay. They're such good people and deserve it. We talked with Cristina for a bit, helped Hna Magdelina prepare a lesson, missed dinner and Hna Vicky kinda got mad, then came home. Not much to say, but not an awful day.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <p>Today started out pretty good. We studied and whatnot, then we had lunch with Hna. Miriam, Patty, and the other elders. Elder Bradford, the new guy, is already sick, so they stayed home. After we had 2 lessons, with 2 new guys that could really progress. First was Efrain, this reference from Rodrigo. He is really trying to change his life, so he is interested. He was just a really sincere guy. Second was this kid Marcelo. I felt the urge to knock his door the other day, even though it was a nice house. Well, we taught him today, and he is pretty cool. The BoM really interests him. Other than those 2 lessons, we just kinda walked around looking for people, but there was literally no one in the streets, it was dead. Oh well, I feel pretty good about today. At times we get home just physically beat, but those are the days where we feel the best spiritually. When we work our hardest, we feel good about whatever results come.</p>

                    <p>7 months!!! Wow, the mission passes really really fast. Today was good. We had church, and I surprised everyone by being there. It was good cause they were happy. I stayed with Oliver the whole meeting basically. Dennys came to church, so he's not inactive, woohoo! We ate with the other 2 elders today, and I got to know Elder Bradford a little better. He's a pretty cool kid. Later we talked to some new people we met, a mom and her daughter. They were good listeners and could really progress. We also talked to Miguel Gottlieb. He's a cool guy, just a bit tough to crack. Then we ate dinner (scones...) and then had a good lesson with Cristian, Magdelina, Madeline, and Magdelina's sister. We had a strong spirit and helped the sister (non member) realize the importance of baptism. I think we really helped her. Oh ya, freaking Hector drew a moustache on a picture of me in chapel, dork. Good end of the week, ready for the next one.</p>

                    <p>And another p-day in the books. This one started out pretty good. In the morning we went to go play futsal with the young men of the ward (well Pinta didn't play.) It was fun, and I'm glad there's actually young men in the ward now. We went to internet, which was just normal. My family went to California without me, so that was kinda sad. For the activity we went to a place called Las Palmas. The way there we rode in a crowded trufi. I sat in the back with Elder Kenney, Elder Skousen, and Elder Christiansen, and it was fun. The place was supposed to be way cool, but it was eh... We just ate then played futsal. It was fun I guess, but nothing special. At night we had a FHE with the Flia Navarro, this less active lady. It was good, and hopefully it will help her to get active. Then we passed by Hna Vicky's, where they were having an FHE with Hno Freddy's family. Good news, they get to keep their house. Welp, that's all for today. Hopefully a good day tomorrow. We played Evopolio, best game ever.</p>
