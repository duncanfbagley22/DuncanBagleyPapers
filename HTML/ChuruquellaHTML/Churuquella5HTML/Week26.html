                      <p>Today turned out pretty well. We had our district meeting and for some reason everyone in our district is just super tired. Hna Soliz and Elder Harris are sick on top of that. It was a good meeting though. Elder Diazgranados might be super lazy, but he is a good meeting teacher. Me and Pinta both fell asleep for about a half hour after lunch. We walked around after that, set up a few appts, and didn't find much. We eventually talked to this lady Erlinda, who we hadn't talked to for like 4 months. She actually read and stuff so that's good. We went to this lesson with a lady who we literally talked to for 2 min the first time. Well she was leaving as we got there, but gave us 10 pieces of bread, cheese, and butter. Not often that people we really don't even know give us breakfast for tomorrow. We then knocked a door and found Carmen, the owner of the Sucre hat factory, which is supposedly really cool. We taught her about the BoM, then we had a meeting with Rodrigo. He's a really good dude, the one of few people in the ward that care about missionary work. Finally at night we talked to Leonardo and Daniel, two kids we met earlier. It was a good lesson, but then their mom/grandma came in and made them leave, so we cut it short. Overall, good day, but I'm really really tired.</p>

                    <p>Well, obviously it's been 3 days since I wrote in my journal, but I have a good reason. Also, my pen died, so I'm using a new one, but that's not important. Well wednesday was a pretty good day. We had a lesson with Oscar and Veronica Reyes in the morning. It was good, but Oscar reads a lot... including antimormon stuff. We talked a lot, but he's gotta decide he wants to know if it's true. Later we had a really good lesson with Dina. There was a strong spirit, especially when I bore a testimony of the Plan of Salvation. I was exhausted after. At night we went to go talk to Hna Estela. There is where everything changed. While talking, I got a call from the zone leaders. They told me I was being transferred to Barrio Jardin in Cochabamba. Well, that was quite a shock. I called the assistants to make sure, and then started calling everyone else to be able to visit them. I was feeling just shocked.</p>

                        <p>Thursday was crazy. First, I had to start packing and all that. Then, we starting visiting. We couldn't visit Hna Vicky, because she is in La Paz, but she said she'd come visit me in Cocha on the way back. First we visited the Flia Plaza. I love that family and I'm gonna miss them so much. Later we visisted the Flia Aguirre. Well leaving them just wasn't fair. First, Hna Patty and Daniela cried and then the worst of all. Oliver asked where I was going, and when I said Cochabamba, he put my hand to his face and said "No te vayas" or "don't go". One of the saddest moments of my life. I'm gonna miss them too. When I was leaving I was so close to crying, but I held it together. At night we visisted Hector, but we are coming back Friday. I stayed up way late finishing packing, and got to bed at 2.
                            <br><br>Friday (Sucre portion): Friday I got up and finished everything, then we went to visited with Hna Sandra, Maria, Hector, and Dennys. It was good to see my 2 baptisms. I'll miss all these guys in Churuquella. The area literally has changed my life. We got to the airport on time, but my flight got delayed. We just talked there for a while. Waiting for the plane to get to the gate, I talked to this guy that wants missionaries sent to him.</p>
