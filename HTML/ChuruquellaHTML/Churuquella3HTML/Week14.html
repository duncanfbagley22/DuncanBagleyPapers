            <h1>Week 14 <small>(November 4, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>Not what I was expecting</h3>
            <p><small>Family and others,<br>
            I am sure the title probably provokes so questions. I will explain.
            This is what happened. Monday I went with Elder Long and Diazgranados
            for P day. Nothing too exciting. At night I was trying to decide
            whether to continue with them, or if it would be easier to go with
            Elder Espina and Harris. I called Harris and met up with them. There
            we were talking to Hna Adams, who was in Cocha. She told us I was
            supposed to be there, so we called the ZLs and they said to head out
            asap. Monday night we went to the bus terminal, and I hopped on a bus,
            all by myself, for a 10 hour bus ride to Cocha from about 8-6 in the
            morning. Awful bus ride. There are 3 classes of bus, Cama (bed), semi
            cama (semi bed), and the one I went on. It was awful awful. Half way
            through the tire exploded and we had to get out and check. It got
            fixed though. I got to Cocha, with 4 hours of awful sleep, and went
            right to the secretary house. After that I found out that Supayabe´s
            surgery was at 7 that night, so I had to go to the hospital and stay
            with him. I stayed there Tuesday from about 2 to Thursday morning.
            Also, awful. The only bright spot was that they brought me food, so I
            at least got to eat. I had to give a blessing to Supayabe, with
            President Dyer. I was super scared, but I think I did ok. Other than
            that, those days were boring. I got to talk to Elder Christensen
            because he was in Cocha too, cause it was time for us to do our
            immigration stuff. Thursday we got up and found out that we were being
            moved to the mission home. Ya... it is really nice. It would be a nice
            house in the states. It is right across the street from the temple, so
            I have a lot of pictures to send that are awesome. Dont think I just
            did nothing though. I was a slave for Hna Dyer the entire 2 days.
            Filed, typing, friending people on Facebook for her, I did it all. We
            ate breakfast lunch and dinner with the Dyers and I even got to make
            cookies in their house. It was a once in a mission experience, so I
            cherish it. I also found out my preliminary release date is June 3, so
            mark the calendars. Saturday we got up and found out we were being
            moved again, to the secretary house. It was dissappointing to leave,
            but a good experience. Saturday we did nothing. Just plain nothing.
            Sunday, we went to church with Elder Gallegos, the finance secretary.
            It was good, but it feels weird to be in a different ward. The cool
            part was that after church we ate with a member. She served a mission
            about 20 years ago in... Quito Ecuador. It was cool to hear about the
            mission that dad served in. She said that in Otavalo they only send
            the hardest workers, so good job dad. Today we are still in Cocha,
            with no plan of what to do. We leave on a plane, thankfully, tomorrow
            morning. This week was probably the slowest in my mission. I really
            just wanna get back to Sucre and work. The area has probably died
            because we couldnt work at all this week. It is frustrating, but I
            have learned a lot hear. From talking to the Dyers, one of the Bishops
            in Cocha, and a few other elders, I have gained a lot of ideas for how
            to help the ward more. The only thing that will be hard next week is
            that Supayabe is still really slow walking. He thought they should
            send him home to get healthy, but President Dyer called the church
            doctors and they say that it shouldnt take more than a few more days,
            but Supayabe has psyched himself out into thinking it will be a while.
            If by next saturday he still doesnt walk well, I think I will get a
            new companion. Lots of changes going on. Havent had a regular day so
            far. I did however get to talk on the phone to Elder Lopez this week
            so that was cool. I wish I had more to say, but obviously not a lot
            happened this week. I have a greater excitement to work, so hopefully
            that will help back in Sucre. <br>That is all for this week. Tune in next
            monday to see what happens next in the life of Elder Bagley.<br><br> Love you
            all so much,
            <br>
            Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <p>29: First day in Cocha, and things got weirder than I thought they could. I woke up and talked to E' Grover and E'
                    Christensen for a while about life. Then I went to get all my medical stuff checked. All good. Then I went to breakfast
                    with a bishop that heps with all the tramites stuff. We had a good talk and I learned some good things. After that I
                    went to the hospital with Supayabe. Turnsout, I'm going to be staying here the whole time with him. Pres and Hna Dyer
                    came by and me and Pres. Dyer gave Supayabe a blessing. I was so scared, but the Spirit helped a lot. He went into surgery,
                    and I was stuck on the couch, eating chicken wings, watching minute to win it. Darn... Anyways, no life is even more
                    different. Crazy stuff.<br><br>
                        30: I've been in the hospital about 36 hours now. Definitely hoping that we leave tomorrow.
                        Today was super slow. There's not much to do in a hospital room. In the morning I got to talk with Elder López, so that
                        was cool. I also went and tried to finish trámites, but I have to wait until tomorrow. I talked to Bishop Davila a lot
                        and got to hang out in a park for a bit. We also went to Globo's, an ice cream shop. Overall, ready to leave.</p>

                    <p>31: And another day of big change. First off, it's Halloween, but that doesn't mean much here. Today changed a lot. We left the hospital today! And, we are now we are staying at the mission hom, which is awesome. It would be an upper close USA home, and it has a crazy good view of the temple. Today I did tramites again, I got to talk to Elder Johnston from the CCM, and he bought me a milkshake. Finally I did some little jobs for Hna. Dyer (putting CO monitors in bags and labeling them) and ya, that's about it. The mission home doesn't even feel like a mission, so it makes me trunky.<br><br>
                        1: Well, really nothing important to say. Still at the mission home. Still bored. Today I did a lot more jobs for Hna. Dyer. Filing stuff, typing stuff, adding friends on Facebook, the normal stuff. My favorite part of the day was either when I got to make cookies, or when we got to go walk around the temple. OTher than that, it was pretty boring. I'm ready to leave. The mission home would be cool to live in normally, but to visit as a missionary isn't that fun. Also, Supayabe is up and down in his emotions. Just keep on going I guess, at least I have a great view of the temple as I'm writing this.</p>

                    <p>2: I'm so ready to be done here. I just wanna go back to Sucre and start working again. Now I'm in the Secrataries (spelling?) house. I'm so bored. There is nothing to do. I guess this is what I need to make sure I go back and work hard. Found out today that Supayabe "should" be able to wkr in 4 days, but I doubt it. He's psyched himself into thinking he won't work for a month. I really just wanna go back to a normal life a work and teach and stuff. Oh well, it is all part of the plan, I just wanna know what the plan is.<br><br>
                        3: Sunday #26<br>Well, I'm still here, I still am bored, and I still wanna leave. I just wanna go back to Sucre and have a normal missionary life. I went to church with Elder Gallegos today. Their ward has a lot more people that come on time. We ate with a member in the ward that serve in Quito, Ecuador, like my dad, so it was cool to hear about that mission. I'm just so ready to get out of here. I figure this trip was just so I could get a little more excited for mission work and give me new ideas. I'm ready for it to be over now.</p>

                    <p>4: Finally, my last day in Cocha. I'm so ready to get out of here. Today was a good p-day though. After going to internet, I went with Elder Supayabe, but then he left with Elder Gomez. I ended up spending the whole day with Elder Lopez and Elder Mickle. I miss those guys so much. We went bowling and then went and had lunch. There I got to talk to a bunch of old friends, Elder Gutierrez, Elder Weekes, etc... It was awesome. We also found out that Elder Supayabe shouldn't work for 15 days, so I don't know what'll happen there. I was talking to with Elder Gallegos tonight and he said something that really hit me. He sold all he had to come on a mission. I gotta realize the sacrifice others make and put the same sacrifice, but just with work. I'm lucky for what I have.</p>
