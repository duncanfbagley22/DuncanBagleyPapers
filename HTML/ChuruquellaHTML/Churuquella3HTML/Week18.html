            <h1>Week 18 <small>(December 2, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>McGyver Time</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Familia,<br>
            So, this week went by really really fast. We have been counting
            down the days for Elder Espina to leave, and it is weird how fast it
            came. He left Saturday morning, so Elder Harris has been with us for
            that time. Here is what happened this week...
            Monday- nothing big, I bought you guys a Christmas present, so
            hopefully Elder Shafer can get it to the states. I am going to email
            him, and get his phone number so you can coordinate. Other than that,
            we just had FHE with Hna Vicky
            Tuesday- cant remember, I think we finally got an ironing board, so
            that was good
            Wednesday- also not sure, really, Wednesday and Tuesday are the days
            that just kinda happen, nothing big that I can usually remember. Oh
            ya, everything we touched turned to gold. We knocked like 5 doors, and
            everyone listened, people even talked to us in a store asking about
            the church. A guy came to answer his door, with his pants a little
            lower than I would have liked... We also helped a family move into
            their new house. Me and Pinta were riding in the moving van with all
            the stuff, and we were crammed in there. We started up a hill, and a
            box fell and hit me in the face. Fun stuff...
            Thursday- Intercambio, I got to go with Elder Diazgranados from
            Colombia. He is a cool guy. A little immature, but still cool. We met
            a cool lady named Dina. She is super nice, and every Sunday she goes
            to the Cemetary to clean the grave of her mom. Every Sunday without
            fail. She has had a lot of people die in her life, and she will find
            out soon enough that she needs the gospel.
            Friday- The final day of Elder Espina. We went to the baptisms that
            they had, two little kids (Elder Harris baptized them, and he had to
            do each 3 times because they kept coming up). After we all went home
            and kinda partied for Espina. Really, all we did was play Uno and I
            had cookies and milk.
            Saturday- We went to the baptisms of Elder Long and Diazgranados. The
            people are great. The guy even fasted like a week ago to do well on
            his tests. He will be great for the ward. We had 4 appts fall through,
            which ties the record.
            Sunday- We had church, and no one came...Ward Council was good though.
            We are having a big Christmas party in 3 weeks, and the thing in
            Bolivia is that for Christmas, people make scones. Great tradition. We
            had a lesson with Hna Sandra, Hector, and Maria. We watched some
            Mormon messages, and I found out I am friends with Hector on Facebook.
            Later we went to Hermana Vicky´s house. They had taken a trip to
            Potosi for a day, and were just getting back. They got out of the car,
            forgot to take the keys out, and the keys got locked in. We didnt know
            what to do. There was a little crack at the top of the window, so we
            tried a bunch of stuff to unlock the car, but nothing worked. Here is
            where I pulled out my McGyver skills. I told Pinta to make a knot and
            a loop in some yarn. I taped a big needle to a hanger, and guided the
            loop until it rested on the crank to open the window. We pulled the
            crank to open the window a little more, then I continued to push the
            crank until somone could fit their arm in to pull it up to unlock. Not
            gonna lie, I felt so cool. Cambios were that night too. No big
            changes. Elder Christensen is leaving Potosi, so I wont see him as
            much anymore. I probably have 6 more weeks here. Also, opened the
            Christmas package. We are in the process of decorating it. I had to
            open the journal present, cause I ran out of pages in my other
            journal. As for investigators, we have a lot of potentials, and we are
            still working with Dennys. We need every prayer we can get. We have
            taught every lesson, he just needs a stronger witness to be baptized.
            It is good he wont do it just to do it, but he wants to be sure.
            Overall, crazy that it is already December. Not sure how Skype will
            work, I will talk to the ZLs about it. I will be home in a year and a
            half, which is really weird. Life is good, there is only a few little
            things left in spanish to learn (past subjunctive tense, it is weird).
            We are about 3 weeks from Christmas, there are at least lights in the
            plaza, so that is cool. I am listening to Christmas music now, so I am
            happy. Not much else to say.<br><br> The church is true, no doubt. Talk to you
            in a week.
            <br><br>Love,<br>
            Elder Bagley</small></p>
