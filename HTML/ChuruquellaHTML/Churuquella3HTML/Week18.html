            <h1>Week 18 <small>(December 2, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>McGyver Time</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Familia,<br>
            So, this week went by really really fast. We have been counting
            down the days for Elder Espina to leave, and it is weird how fast it
            came. He left Saturday morning, so Elder Harris has been with us for
            that time. Here is what happened this week...
            Monday- nothing big, I bought you guys a Christmas present, so
            hopefully Elder Shafer can get it to the states. I am going to email
            him, and get his phone number so you can coordinate. Other than that,
            we just had FHE with Hna Vicky
            Tuesday- cant remember, I think we finally got an ironing board, so
            that was good
            Wednesday- also not sure, really, Wednesday and Tuesday are the days
            that just kinda happen, nothing big that I can usually remember. Oh
            ya, everything we touched turned to gold. We knocked like 5 doors, and
            everyone listened, people even talked to us in a store asking about
            the church. A guy came to answer his door, with his pants a little
            lower than I would have liked... We also helped a family move into
            their new house. Me and Pinta were riding in the moving van with all
            the stuff, and we were crammed in there. We started up a hill, and a
            box fell and hit me in the face. Fun stuff...
            Thursday- Intercambio, I got to go with Elder Diazgranados from
            Colombia. He is a cool guy. A little immature, but still cool. We met
            a cool lady named Dina. She is super nice, and every Sunday she goes
            to the Cemetary to clean the grave of her mom. Every Sunday without
            fail. She has had a lot of people die in her life, and she will find
            out soon enough that she needs the gospel.
            Friday- The final day of Elder Espina. We went to the baptisms that
            they had, two little kids (Elder Harris baptized them, and he had to
            do each 3 times because they kept coming up). After we all went home
            and kinda partied for Espina. Really, all we did was play Uno and I
            had cookies and milk.
            Saturday- We went to the baptisms of Elder Long and Diazgranados. The
            people are great. The guy even fasted like a week ago to do well on
            his tests. He will be great for the ward. We had 4 appts fall through,
            which ties the record.
            Sunday- We had church, and no one came...Ward Council was good though.
            We are having a big Christmas party in 3 weeks, and the thing in
            Bolivia is that for Christmas, people make scones. Great tradition. We
            had a lesson with Hna Sandra, Hector, and Maria. We watched some
            Mormon messages, and I found out I am friends with Hector on Facebook.
            Later we went to Hermana Vicky´s house. They had taken a trip to
            Potosi for a day, and were just getting back. They got out of the car,
            forgot to take the keys out, and the keys got locked in. We didnt know
            what to do. There was a little crack at the top of the window, so we
            tried a bunch of stuff to unlock the car, but nothing worked. Here is
            where I pulled out my McGyver skills. I told Pinta to make a knot and
            a loop in some yarn. I taped a big needle to a hanger, and guided the
            loop until it rested on the crank to open the window. We pulled the
            crank to open the window a little more, then I continued to push the
            crank until somone could fit their arm in to pull it up to unlock. Not
            gonna lie, I felt so cool. Cambios were that night too. No big
            changes. Elder Christensen is leaving Potosi, so I wont see him as
            much anymore. I probably have 6 more weeks here. Also, opened the
            Christmas package. We are in the process of decorating it. I had to
            open the journal present, cause I ran out of pages in my other
            journal. As for investigators, we have a lot of potentials, and we are
            still working with Dennys. We need every prayer we can get. We have
            taught every lesson, he just needs a stronger witness to be baptized.
            It is good he wont do it just to do it, but he wants to be sure.
            Overall, crazy that it is already December. Not sure how Skype will
            work, I will talk to the ZLs about it. I will be home in a year and a
            half, which is really weird. Life is good, there is only a few little
            things left in spanish to learn (past subjunctive tense, it is weird).
            We are about 3 weeks from Christmas, there are at least lights in the
            plaza, so that is cool. I am listening to Christmas music now, so I am
            happy. Not much else to say.<br><br> The church is true, no doubt. Talk to you
            in a week.
            <br><br>Love,<br>
            Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <p>26: There's gotta be success in this area, I'm just not sure what it is. We had 3 appts fall through today. I think the record is 4, so not quite. We tried a lot harder in finding people. We talked to more people and maybe we'll get results. We even talked to a Jehovah's Witness who gave us limes, so something. We also taught Miguel Leon. He's great, just a little slow. At night we helped Hno. Ledo move. We packed a bunch of stuff in a moving van, then me and Pinta got it. 2 minutes in and we went uphill and a bunch of stuff fell on my face. Anyways, we needed to help them to get on their good side as they come into the ward. Anyways, no big numbers, but we worked all day.
                        <br><br>
                        27: Ya know, Bolivia is kinda weird sometimes. Or all the time. Just a thought. Today was good and bad. We found 2 awesome people in the street, but both were from different areas, so we had to give the references to other people. We taught Fredy today. He's a little weird, but he accepted the baptismal challenge after some "fighting". We also ran into Nancy and Jorge, and taught them the restauracion and stuff. Nancy is scared to get an answer. We finally had FHE with Hno Fredy's family, Javier, and his wife. We taught about the family and stuff, it was pretty solid. Tomorrow could be successful, we'll just wait and see.

                      <p>28: Wow, everything we touched today turned to gold. We knocked doors in the afternoon, no one shut us down. Even the people that didn't want anything were nice. Awesome seeing the blessings come. We taught Dennys. He is still unsure about baptism, so I just pray he gets there. Harold Guereca helped a lot in the lesson. Overall, really good day, on intercambios with Diazgranados tomorrow, chau.
                        <br><br>
                        29: Intercambio! Today I went with E' Diazgranados. I learned a bunch from him. He is really persistent and doesn't wait for people to be perfect, he just is persistent and it gets results. We taught a new lady named Dina, she was great and understood stuff. We also taught Roxana. Espina and Harris had baptisms, and they kept coming up so Harris had to do each 3 times. Overall, decent day, nothing to complain about.
                        <br><br>
                        30: Today was the DespEspina... Espina is gone and it is weird. I'm gonna miss him. Today was aight. We had Harris with us all day. We had 3 lessons fall through which stinks. We went to the baptisms of Long and Diazgranados, then had a good lesson with Dennys. Still isn't sure about baptism, but there's progress. I really hope he gets there. Finally, we went with Harris super far away, got a ride back with a crazy, inactive, and now I've finished November. Time is flying.

                      <h3>December 1, 2013</h3>
                      <p>1: Woohoo, a new journal! I opened my Christmas Package early, cause I ran out of pages in my other journal. Today I finished 4 months in Sucre. Crazy stuff. We didn't get anyone at church today, which isn't fun. We had 2 good lessons, one with Hna Sandra, Hector, and Maria, and the other with the Flia Plaza. They are probably two of my favorite families. We went Hna Vicky's later. They were just getting back from a day trip to Potosi, and Camila accidently locked the keys in the car. Through a small hole in the window, me and Pinta managed to open the window enough to get an arm in to unlock the door. We used some yarn, tape, a sewing needle, and a hanger. McGyverstyle. Pinta made a knot in the yarn and slowly lowered it until it was by the crank to open the window. I guided the yarn using a needle taped to a bent hanger. We felt so cool, and not to brag, but it was my idea, and Harris didn't think it would work. Today was also cambios. I'm staying, and really the only big change is that E' Harris's new comp sounds tiras. We'll see, hopefully not. I called all my friends and I'm gonna be the only one outside of Cocha now. I talked to E' Toomer for like 49 minutes, just catching up. Well, I'm tired. Tomorrow we'll put up more of the paper Christmas tree my family sent me. It is a great idea. Starting cambio 5 tomorrow, yikes<br><br>Sunday #24

                      <p>2: P-day, woohoo! We didn't really do much, but p-days are always good. I started out the morning washing clothes, which was very necessary to say the least. Then we had internet, which was surprisingly fast today. Then me, Pinta, Harris, Long, and Diazgranados went to a place called La Posada. It was a nice restaurant, a bit pricy (for Bolivia), but still nice. Later me Harris, Long, and I went hat searching. We found a lot of cool hates like old Castoral oil hats, hats from Suway, McDonalds, Cabela's, and even a KSL5TV from Utah. It was fun. At night we had a lesson with Nancy and Roberto and Jorde aka Coco. We tried to focus on the Book of Mormon. I think it went well enough. At night we put up the Christmas tree and decorated it. It actually looks really good. I'm proud. Tomorrow Harris's comp comes, so that'll be interesting. We had 10 appts already set up for this week, so that is good. Hoping to get some good progress this week.
