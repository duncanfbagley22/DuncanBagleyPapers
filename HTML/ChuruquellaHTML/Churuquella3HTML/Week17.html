            <h1>Week 17 <small>(November 25, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>Week Number ?</h3>
            <p><small>Dear familia,<br>
            This week was back to a real normal week, as far as a mission
            gets. Every day really is different. It is officially one month from
            Christmas, so get ready. This week held a lot of interesting things in
            it. First off we had a conference wednesday with the missionaries here
            and in Potosi. It is weird the mindset of a missionary. I went into it
            excited looking for things to learn. Back home, it was just 2 hours
            that I had to sit and watch people talk. This conference was great.
            The assistants and the Dyers talked. My favorite part was when the
            assistants showed a video, it had a few talks, video clips, and music.
            It hit me like a train. The spirit was super strong. Elder Holland, it
            is always him that does it, said something great. He said, according
            to his opinion, that the mission (and life) isnt easy because the
            atonement wasnt easy. If we want to understand the atonement, we have
            to experience a little. We were all on the verge of tears, which was
            different. Friday night we had a night of videos. Problem was, right
            now it is rainy season here. Every few days it rains super hard, and
            friday was one of those days. It started at 7, but because it was
            raining and we are in Bolivia, it didnt start until 8. We watched
            Charly, which is filmed entirely in Utah, so I recognized everything.
            Saturday rained a bunch too. When it rains, the streets look like
            rivers, and every morning after the streets are filled with rocks that
            the rain brought down the hills. Sunday was actually good. We had 4
            people come to church, but I will get to them later. The first
            counselor called us Saturday afternoon and told me I had a talk. My
            first one after 5 months. It was good. I kinda just went up and
            talked, shared a few scriptures, and bore my testimony. People said it
            was good, so that is good. Not really scary or anything. I have been
            asking all the latinos to rank my spanish, and everyone says 7 or 8.
            Sometimes when I talk in english, spanish words come out. Sunday we
            also had a area conference for South America Noroeste. The presidency
            spoke and it was all about ward council. We are gonna do it a lot more
            effectively now. Other interesting things this week is that Hna
            Vicky´s daughter is here from Spain. She has been there for 7 years.
            She is cool, but thinks she is all that sometimes. She is Camila´s
            actual mom, so i think she is lame for leaving her for 7 years of her
            life. We have FHE with them tonight, so we will she how it goes. Elder
            Pinta is great. He knows a lot already, and I get along with him
            really well. I am lucky to always get comps that are easy to get along
            with. He also speaks a bit of english, so I help him. As far as
            investigators, I wanna focus on 3.
            Dennys- he is investigator number one. He has a baptism date for dec 7
            and I feel like we will reach it. He is Hector´s friend and they are
            both good. His parents dont come to church and go to some weird
            christian one, so we just have to watch out for them trying to stop
            it, but they are our friends so we should be good.
            Gorki- he is a little 12 year old that is more spiritual than any kid
            I have ever met. He told us this week he thinks that the church is the
            only true one and wants to get baptized. He doesnt understand 100%,
            but we are getting there.
            Fredy- he is an old guy that heard about the church like 40 years ago.
            He has read the BoM, but now he wants to do it looking for the spirit.
            He talks in a really low voice. He likes to talk, which is like all
            old people here.
            Overall, a pretty good week. We are starting to see a bit of success
            coming, and we are working pretty hard. Life is good, Elder Espina
            leaves Saturday, so that´ll be weird. Transfers are next week, but I
            should be staying. <br><br>Hope all in well in the 801, send my greetings to
            anyone that wants them. Hasta Diciembre!
            <br><br>Love,<br>
            Elder Bagley</small></p>
