            <h1>Week 17 <small>(November 25, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>Week Number ?</h3>
            <p><small>Dear familia,<br>
            This week was back to a real normal week, as far as a mission
            gets. Every day really is different. It is officially one month from
            Christmas, so get ready. This week held a lot of interesting things in
            it. First off we had a conference wednesday with the missionaries here
            and in Potosi. It is weird the mindset of a missionary. I went into it
            excited looking for things to learn. Back home, it was just 2 hours
            that I had to sit and watch people talk. This conference was great.
            The assistants and the Dyers talked. My favorite part was when the
            assistants showed a video, it had a few talks, video clips, and music.
            It hit me like a train. The spirit was super strong. Elder Holland, it
            is always him that does it, said something great. He said, according
            to his opinion, that the mission (and life) isnt easy because the
            atonement wasnt easy. If we want to understand the atonement, we have
            to experience a little. We were all on the verge of tears, which was
            different. Friday night we had a night of videos. Problem was, right
            now it is rainy season here. Every few days it rains super hard, and
            friday was one of those days. It started at 7, but because it was
            raining and we are in Bolivia, it didnt start until 8. We watched
            Charly, which is filmed entirely in Utah, so I recognized everything.
            Saturday rained a bunch too. When it rains, the streets look like
            rivers, and every morning after the streets are filled with rocks that
            the rain brought down the hills. Sunday was actually good. We had 4
            people come to church, but I will get to them later. The first
            counselor called us Saturday afternoon and told me I had a talk. My
            first one after 5 months. It was good. I kinda just went up and
            talked, shared a few scriptures, and bore my testimony. People said it
            was good, so that is good. Not really scary or anything. I have been
            asking all the latinos to rank my spanish, and everyone says 7 or 8.
            Sometimes when I talk in english, spanish words come out. Sunday we
            also had a area conference for South America Noroeste. The presidency
            spoke and it was all about ward council. We are gonna do it a lot more
            effectively now. Other interesting things this week is that Hna
            Vicky´s daughter is here from Spain. She has been there for 7 years.
            She is cool, but thinks she is all that sometimes. She is Camila´s
            actual mom, so i think she is lame for leaving her for 7 years of her
            life. We have FHE with them tonight, so we will she how it goes. Elder
            Pinta is great. He knows a lot already, and I get along with him
            really well. I am lucky to always get comps that are easy to get along
            with. He also speaks a bit of english, so I help him. As far as
            investigators, I wanna focus on 3.
            Dennys- he is investigator number one. He has a baptism date for dec 7
            and I feel like we will reach it. He is Hector´s friend and they are
            both good. His parents dont come to church and go to some weird
            christian one, so we just have to watch out for them trying to stop
            it, but they are our friends so we should be good.
            Gorki- he is a little 12 year old that is more spiritual than any kid
            I have ever met. He told us this week he thinks that the church is the
            only true one and wants to get baptized. He doesnt understand 100%,
            but we are getting there.
            Fredy- he is an old guy that heard about the church like 40 years ago.
            He has read the BoM, but now he wants to do it looking for the spirit.
            He talks in a really low voice. He likes to talk, which is like all
            old people here.
            Overall, a pretty good week. We are starting to see a bit of success
            coming, and we are working pretty hard. Life is good, Elder Espina
            leaves Saturday, so that´ll be weird. Transfers are next week, but I
            should be staying. <br><br>Hope all in well in the 801, send my greetings to
            anyone that wants them. Hasta Diciembre!
            <br><br>Love,<br>
            Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <p>19: Today was a rollercoaster day. We went to Rumi Rumi for the first time in about a month and half, and it was super tiras. We got denied by Delina, an old cholita from Rumi Rumi. Kinda hurt a little bit. Then it started raining really hard. We kept going cause we are missionaries, and the rain got worse. We knocked on the door of Mijael, a kid we've been wanting to talk to for a while, and he let us in out of pitty. We did get a lesson in though, and maybe that'll get somewhere. After a chopi english lesson, we taught Dennys. We taught the Sabbath Day and Dennys sounds good. Overall, good way to a crappy day.</p>

                      <p>20: Today was good, but I'm kinda mad. Firstly, I'm pretty sure Cusi or Diazgranados stole my candy sent from home, of which contained stuff that cost money for my parents to send. Also, Diazgranados and Long played a joke on me by telling me I had to write a talk, which I didn't. People are still immature. The conference we had today was awesome. We heard from the Dyers and the assistants. They talked about not wasting time and working more efficiently. The APs showed a video that really hit me. I understand the atonement a little better now. I gain an understanding when I experience it. The mission will never be easy, but neither was the atonement. I was overwhelmed by the spirit I almost cried. Super spiritual experience.
                    <br><br>
                    21: Today actually wasn't too bad. It didn't start out amazing, but it was decent overall. We met Hna. Vicky's daughter, the real mom of Camila, from Spain. She's cool, but lame for not living with her daughter for 7 years. She brought like a PS3, Nintendo DS, and other gifts, but that doesn't make up for 7 years of life. We went to Rumi Rumi, and nothing happened. We were walking in the street and some guy stopped us. His name is Mario, and he had heard of the LDS church before. He seemed pretty interested. We also talked with Fredy, and he is pretty good. He wants to read the BoM looking for the spirit. Finally, a good lesson with Hna. Sandra, who is still solid. Overall, the day was good enough.</p>

                      <p>22: We don't have water :( I smell really bad, and the fact I can't shower doesn't help. Other than that, today was eh... We had district meeting and what not, which wasn't awful. We only got 2 lessons in today. First we talked to some girl named Wara. Who knows, maybe she'll progress. Then we taught Dennys the word of wisdom. I feel like we will be able to baptize him. He listens and agrees with everything we say. Then we had a ward movie night. It kinda sucked cause it started raining and not a lot of people came. We watched Charly, some non-church/church movie with terrible acting. It was filmed in Salt Lake, so that part was cool. Overall, más o menos.
                    <br><br>
                    23: Today was actually pretty successful. We had english classes, still don't help a lot. Not many come. Later we got home, studied, and finally got water after 2 days. At 1:45, we finally found out who we had lunch with, Juan Pablo the 1st counselor. We had Pica lo macho, which is the dish of Cocha. We also ate with his friend Yoshi, a weird Japanes guy. I couldn't finish it, I was so full. They after an incompetent Taxi driver, we had a lesson with Fabiola. Then we talked to Javier Aguirre. He is still cool and I'm hoping he'll get to church tomorrow. Finally, after visiting the Flia Plaza (while it rained super hard) we taught Gorki Leon. He said he believes it is the true church and he wants to be baptized. Overall, good enough day.</p>

                      <p>24: Sunday #23<br>Sunday are always exhausting. I think it is a divine thing to only have 6 days of work a week. Anymore and I'd die. Today we had 4 people at church. Dennys, Gorki, the mom of Hna. Sandra (unexpected), and Fredy. It feels good when your work for the week pays off. I also had to give a talk today, it would've been amazing... but they only gave me 5 minutes. There was 2 bad things today. First, we didn't have lunch. We couldn't find out where to go. Second, we think someone has been sneaking into our room and stealing my candy. Candy isn't a big deal, just that someone is coming in and doing stuff without permission. Finally, we had a leadership conference area broadcast about ward council. It was good, the area presidency spoke and gave advice, which should help. Right now, Harris and Espina are fighting cause Harris "needs" to go to the gym, but it is Espina's last p-day and he doesn't want to. I'm on Espina's side, but I don't wanna get in the middle. Glad me and Pinta don't fight.
                        <br><br>
                        25: Another unplanned p-day. One of these days, they're actually gonna plan something. Today we did get something done. For lunch we went to Estacion's pensionista. LAter I went and bought gifts to send hom to my family. An elder is going home in a week and he said he could take everything to Utah. Then we had a lesson with Gorki, then an FHE with Hna. Vicky that didn't turn out too well, we weren't focused. Overall, decent enough day.
