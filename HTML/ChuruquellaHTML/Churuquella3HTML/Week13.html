            <h1>Week 13 <small>(October 28, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>He came, he saw... and then he left</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
            How is everyone? Sounds like everyone is doing well. I am sure my
            title is a bit confusing, so I will explain. Between the last monday
            and today a lot has happened. Wednesday morning I got my new
            companion, Elder Supayabe from Santa Cruz. He has been a member for a
            little over 2 years, and he left for the mission the same day I did.
            We have 8 months combined. In our new district, Elder Espina has 23
            months, and the rest combined have 31. We are super young. Anyways, we
            had a pretty good first 2 days together. He is a great missionary.
            Well it all came down the night of Thursday. He was complaining of
            some pain, so I asked where, and he said he had a small hernia. We
            called Hna. Dyer and she said to go to the clinic. So after the
            district reunion we went. Only Elder Cedano and Elder Long left our
            district. Their replacements are Supayabe and Elder Diazgranados from
            Columbia. The other cool change in Sucre is that Steven Braun´s cousin
            Elder Kenney is in the other zone now. Anyways, we went to the clinic
            afterwards. After sitting for an hour, which was awful, he went in.
            Turns out, he has a hernia, and has had it for about a month. The
            doctor told him surgery was necessary. With the surgery, he will be
            out for about a month. I have no idea what the plan is. We called Hna.
            Dyer again and she said to send him to Cocha. He hopped on a bus
            yesterday and headed for Cocha. So now I have been in a trio with
            Elder Espina and Elder Harris. I will be in a trio at least a week.
            I´ll be honest, this week was hard. First having to change companions
            is really weird. Second, after we heard he shouldnt really walk much,
            as it could do permanent damage, so we stayed at home a lot. It is
            hard to not work. We already have a lack of success here, and when we
            cant work it makes it worse. I am pushing hard for success, but I keep
            getting things thrown at me. Just gotta realize it all happens for a
            reason. Anyways, as far as investigators go... iffy. No one came to
            church yesterday. The good thing that did happen was that Miguel and
            Gorki Leon came to the ward costume party, so that was good. Oh yeah,
            Hector said he thinks he will go on a mission, so that is good.
            Anyways, I keep going I guess. I am used to mission life now. Spanish
            is fine. Everyone thinks I have more time. I figure I am going to be
            in Sucre a while now. I really like the ward, but we arent finding
            that much success. Which brings my to my next point. Please help the
            missionaries. They need it. If there is anyone you can present, do it.
            You wont regret it. If you have any ideas for a ward mission plan, we
            are brainstorming right now for it. <br>Even with all the hard stuff, the
            church is still true. Dont forget it. <br><br>Os amo, y sigan en el evangelio.
            Sé que todo es verdadero. Realmente, estoy haciendo la obra del Señor.
            <br><br>Love you so much,<br>
            Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <p>22: The last night with Elder López. I know everyone does it, but it'll be weird to change companions. I really am gonna miss Elder López. I feel like I've made a friend that'll last forever. Today we basically just went around saying by. We ended up with 2 lessons, so somehow it was better than days when we worked all day. It was really hard to watch him say bye realizing it'll be my turn in a matter of time. We also had our English class tonight. The closest people we visited were Hna Sandra, Hector, Maria, and the Flia. Plaza. Tomorrow is the big day, so we'll see how it goes.</p>

                    <p>23: Day 1 with a new comp. His name is Elder Supayabe from Santa Cruz. He is pretty cool. He plays soccer pretty well. Doesn't speak much english. He draws insanely well. It is a little different having a new comp. He has his way of doing things, and I have mine. We don't argue or anything, I just can see we are different. Today we went around introducing him. He is starting to warm up a little bit, so that is good. I feel like with what he knows and what I know, we can make a good team. I just need time to get used to him.<br><br>
                    24: Day 2 with the new guy. Today went a lot better. There's still a lot of room to grow with him, but it is better. I think we can have a lot of success together, just have to give it time. Today it rained super hard. We had to run to get out of it, but we were soaked. We had a few good lessons today. We met 2 cool investigators. We were gonna pass them by, but for some reason I just had to stop and talk, and it worked out well. We also talked to Hector, and he is still super great. Also with the Flia. Leon and that could go somewhere. Overall, still adjusting to a new comp, but it'll all come.</p>

                    <h3>October 25-26, 2013</h3>
                    <p>25: Fetching flipping fetch! So here's the deal. Supayabe has a hernia. We went to the doctor today, and he said he needs an operation. He's had it for about a month, and he can't really walk without pain and can't walk without making it worse, so we can't go anywhere without a taxi. We did have a lesson with the Flia. Plaza and then went to the ward costume party which was way fun. I went as Elder Boyd. Anyways, Supayabe is going to Cocha next week for a 2nd opinion. Until then, little bit of working. After that (the operation includes about a month of doing nothing) I don't know what I'm gonna do. It's frustrating cause there's nothing I can do.<br><br>
                        26: Well, today was interesting to say the least. Started out with English classes at 8. I went with E Harris. We had 35 people there, a lot. After that I was at home cause Supayabe shouldn't walk or anything. We had lunch, then came back. We had a lesson with Nancy that went well. She is slowly progressing. Then we came home for like 3 hours. I cleaned the house cause I had nothing else to do. At 8 I went to a lesson with Dennys and brought Espina. Dennys wasn't there but we found a really drunk guy. He just kept talking to us for like 20 minutes, inviting us to dinner, saying he taught math like the USA, and saying a bunch of nothing. We finally got away by lying... for a good reason. Not a fan of doing nothing. Supayabe leaves tomorrow at 6:30 at night. Then it gets real interesting.</p>

                    <p>27: Sunday #19<br>And there he goes... I'm currently companionless. Supayabe left for Cocha tonight. This next week will be interesting without him. Today kinda sucked, we didn't get anyone at church. It was the primary program though, so that was cool. Oliver reciting the first article of faith was great. Later we had lunch with Madeline and Magdelina. I ate a form of Chuño, and it wasn't awful. We then had a lesson with Javier Aguirre. I read Ether 12:6 and I hope that helps him. Then we just went to the terminal to drop Supayabe off. I've been arguing with Elder Harris about not going to the gym. I think I won. Overall, gonna be an interesting week.
                        <br><br>
                        28: Well, a lot happened today. It was p-day first off. We didn't really do anything too exciting. We went to internet, then to Eureka, and then to the stake to play futsal. I did pretty well, and our team never lost. I heard some Latino say I play well, so that always makes me feel good. At night I was with Espina and Harris, and from talking to Hna. Adams, I found out that I should've gone to Cocha too. I called Cusi and found out I was leaving in an hours, so I packed up, and left on a 10hr bus ride all by myself. The tire exploded on the way too. Crazy stuff happened today, but I'm safe and sound in Cocha.</p>
