            <h1>Week 15 <small>(November 11, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>One is the loneliest number...</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Fambam,<br>
            Well, I am back safe and sound in Sucremanta. This week was so much
            faster than the last week. I am sure the title is probably sparking
            some interest... So this is what happened. Monday, after I had p day
            in Cocha with Elder Lopez which was awesome, we found out I was coming
            back tuesday morning. Supayabe however, is on his way to his house
            right now cause he has to go back to get healthy. He wont come back
            until the next cambio, beginning of december. So that means... I am
            the only missionary in the whole mission without a companion. It is...
            different...hard... and ya... We have an odd number of missionaries,
            so I just have to wait, and wait, and wait. Tuesday and Wednesday I
            was with an elder on his way to Potosi, but had to wait cause there
            was blockeos, no sure how that translates, but it is when little
            pueblos block the roads in protest. Wednesday was all day service.
            First, as a zone, we went to a place to help plant potatoes. That
            includes scraping up 6 inches of manure that smelled horrible.
            Thursday I got to go with Elder Herndon and Elder Cusiatao, the zone
            leaders, as they came to help revive my area. It was fun to learn from
            them, and actually get some work done. Friday I went with Elder Long
            and Elder Diazgranados. Not a lot happened, until like 9 o´clock. We
            had to wait outside for a bit, cause everyone has to drop me off with
            Elder Espina and Harris, cause they are like my babysitters. We were
            waiting, and this teenager and her little brother came over and sat by
            us. The little kid was playing with a basketball, so naturally, that
            drew my interest. I started playing with him, and showing off a
            little, but mostly playing. I ended up talking to the girl, and we
            (not sure who we are) will go visit this week. Saturday was stake
            conference. President Dyer and President Jensen (Jay E Jensen) who is
            the new temple president spoke. It was great. Sunday, I got to go on
            splits with Hector. It wasnt too eventful, except for the drunk guy
            that stopped us. It was quite the experience with the drunk guy. He
            was mad I was white, kissed hector´s head, had us stare at the sky for
            like 5 minutes, wanted to have me kneel down and kiss a stone to show
            my humility, and then started to cry. Just a fun day. It was cool to
            go with Hector though, just 3 months ago we found him, and now he
            comes with us. Well, as far as companions go... I could literally get
            one any day. President Dyer told me there is someone coming, they have
            his name and everything, they just dont know when. It will either be
            someone who was waiting for their visa, or someone from the CCM,
            meaning I would have to train. As I am typing, there is a big protest
            in the street, so we cant leave for a while. They are shooting off
            fireworks and stuff and yelling for who knows what. Oh well, life is
            good. It will go a lot faster if I get a companion, but still good.
            <br>Hope everything is good at home. Send my love to erbody, and stay
            strong in the gospel. <br><br>Love you all, talk to you next week. <br>Chau
            <br>Elder Bagley</small></p>
