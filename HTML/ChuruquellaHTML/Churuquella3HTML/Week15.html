            <h1>Week 15 <small>(November 11, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>One is the loneliest number...</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Fambam,<br>
            Well, I am back safe and sound in Sucremanta. This week was so much
            faster than the last week. I am sure the title is probably sparking
            some interest... So this is what happened. Monday, after I had p day
            in Cocha with Elder Lopez which was awesome, we found out I was coming
            back tuesday morning. Supayabe however, is on his way to his house
            right now cause he has to go back to get healthy. He wont come back
            until the next cambio, beginning of december. So that means... I am
            the only missionary in the whole mission without a companion. It is...
            different...hard... and ya... We have an odd number of missionaries,
            so I just have to wait, and wait, and wait. Tuesday and Wednesday I
            was with an elder on his way to Potosi, but had to wait cause there
            was blockeos, no sure how that translates, but it is when little
            pueblos block the roads in protest. Wednesday was all day service.
            First, as a zone, we went to a place to help plant potatoes. That
            includes scraping up 6 inches of manure that smelled horrible.
            Thursday I got to go with Elder Herndon and Elder Cusiatao, the zone
            leaders, as they came to help revive my area. It was fun to learn from
            them, and actually get some work done. Friday I went with Elder Long
            and Elder Diazgranados. Not a lot happened, until like 9 o´clock. We
            had to wait outside for a bit, cause everyone has to drop me off with
            Elder Espina and Harris, cause they are like my babysitters. We were
            waiting, and this teenager and her little brother came over and sat by
            us. The little kid was playing with a basketball, so naturally, that
            drew my interest. I started playing with him, and showing off a
            little, but mostly playing. I ended up talking to the girl, and we
            (not sure who we are) will go visit this week. Saturday was stake
            conference. President Dyer and President Jensen (Jay E Jensen) who is
            the new temple president spoke. It was great. Sunday, I got to go on
            splits with Hector. It wasnt too eventful, except for the drunk guy
            that stopped us. It was quite the experience with the drunk guy. He
            was mad I was white, kissed hector´s head, had us stare at the sky for
            like 5 minutes, wanted to have me kneel down and kiss a stone to show
            my humility, and then started to cry. Just a fun day. It was cool to
            go with Hector though, just 3 months ago we found him, and now he
            comes with us. Well, as far as companions go... I could literally get
            one any day. President Dyer told me there is someone coming, they have
            his name and everything, they just dont know when. It will either be
            someone who was waiting for their visa, or someone from the CCM,
            meaning I would have to train. As I am typing, there is a big protest
            in the street, so we cant leave for a while. They are shooting off
            fireworks and stuff and yelling for who knows what. Oh well, life is
            good. It will go a lot faster if I get a companion, but still good.
            <br>Hope everything is good at home. Send my love to erbody, and stay
            strong in the gospel. <br><br>Love you all, talk to you next week. <br>Chau
            <br>Elder Bagley</small></p>

                    <h3>November 5, 2013</h3>
                    <p>5: I'm back in Sucre! We left on a plane at 9:20 and got here at about 10. Elder Supayabe is going to Santa Cruz to get better I think. I don't think he's gonna be my comp anymore. Problem is, I don't know when I'll get a new comp. Today I aws with Elder Gomez from Peru while he waits for the blockeos to stop so he can go to Potosí. We just visited his old converts in Sucre, as he served in Delicias before. I'm just frustrated not having anything, not even a companion. I just want everything to get resolved.</p>

                    <h3>November 6-7, 2013</h3>
                    <p>6: Well, year. From everything that I've heard, it's starting to sound like I might not even have a companion for the rest of this cambio. Not something I'm excited for. It could be really hard. Not too happy about it, but it could be worse. Today I was with Elder Gomez again and it was all service. First was with the zone in Elder Harris's area. We were literally moving poop. We shoveled a bunch of manure (spelling) and helped plant potatoes. It smelled awful. After, me and Gomez moved over 1000 bricks for the Flia. Diaz. It also was also. I was just glad to be helping someone because the last week I did nothing. This could be a very long cambio if I don't get a companion. Oh well, must be part of the plan.
                        <br><br>7: Well, now I know I'm not gonna have a companion. It's really hard. I'm getting kinda depressed cause it is hard to see the silver lining. Today I got to go with Elder Cusiatao and Elder Herndon. We went to one of the farthest places in my area, barrio Bolivia. There literally was nothing there. Super tiras. Later we had a good lesson with Bolivia, a less active, and found some new people and took down some appts. It is gonna be a long cambio, but there has gotta be some reason to it.</p>

                    <h3>November 8-9, 2013</h3>
                    <p>8: This whole going without companion thing really has its ups and downs. Today had both. I was Elder Long and Elder Diazgranados today. We tried to work in my area, but then Diazgranados got sick so we sat in the house for a while. That was hard for me. My area is doing poorly, and it is getting worse. There was a silver lining though. At night we were just sitting at the cemetary, and we started talked to this girl. I started dribbling a basketball with her little brother and (I was showing off a little) but we became firneds and she even lives in my area. It was cool to she the hand of the Lord helping me when I needed it.
                    <br><br>9: Well, today was full of meetings. First, at 7, I had to go with Espina and Harris to their ward council. After I had an english class. It wasn't the best one I've given, they all showed up 40min late, and they just didn't wanna participate. After that, and lunch with the Flia. Espejo, we had lots of meetings. First at 2 a meeting with the secretaries, then at 4 priesthood meeting, then at 6:30 the overall stake conference meeting. The Dyers were here and also Pres. Jay E Jensen, the temple president. The things that hit me most in the meetings were 1 )Listen to your mother's teachings 2) If you know the "why", it won't matter the "how" as long as it gets done.<br>Overall, decent day. Espina is sick though. Also, I might get a comp soon.</p>

                    <h3>November 10-11, 2013</h3>
                    <p>10: Sunday #21<br>This week went so much faster than last week. I can't imagine how fast it'll go once I have something to do. Today finished up stake conference. Pres and Hna Dyer and Pres. Jensen talking, scones, and free cake at the end make a pretty good day. After, I got to go on splits with Hector. We ate lunch with Hno. Fredy, and then started. We ended up coming in contact with a super drunk guy. He was mad cause I was a gringo, kiss Hector on the head, told us to look at the sky at nothing, started crying, told me to kneel and kiss a stone, and even tried to steal my tag (which made me mad). We did have a good lesson with Dennys and it was an overall good experience. Just 3 months ago, we met him, and now I can go teaching which him. Ok, ready for p-day.
                        <br><br>11: I looked back in my journal, and they (every entry) for about a month is just sad. I haven't had a super solid day in a while. Not that they're bad days, but I want one super good and exciting. Today was p-day. Was forced to go to the gym by E' Harris, went to internet (found out Hna Heinrich from the CCM had to go home with health problems, sad), played volleyball with the zone, ate, went to the stake center and talked. I'm just so ready for a companion at this point. Oh well, time to start another week. I have a feeling this one'll be better than the other 3 combined.
