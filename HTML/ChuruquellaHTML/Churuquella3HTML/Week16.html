            <h1>Week 16 <small>(November 18, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>It´s a Boy!</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family<br>
            First things first. Happy Birthday Dadio! Hope you are hittin up
            the clubs or partying hard on your birthday...or just having a nice
            day with the family. I feel like every week changes so much for me
            now. Week one with Supayabe, 2 in Cocha, 3 without comp, and 4...
            something we werent expecting. I will get to that later. So for last p
            day, we just did nothing. Tuesday I got to go out with 2 other elders
            in my zone. Elder Sanchez from La Paz and Elder Bartel from Idaho.
            They came over to my area to help me out a bit with my dead area. We
            taught a couple lessons and they taught me a lot of stuff. Wednesday I
            went with Elder Espina and Elder Harris. It was ok I guess. I liked
            spending time with them cause they are like my best friends in the
            mission. We didnt accomplish much, but it was still fun. Espina was in
            a verbal arguement with someone that wouldnt let us talk to his sister
            who was semi interested. Then we just watched a movie with a recent
            convert. That night was interesting. I was in the middle of a prayer
            when the phone rang. I finished and answered. It was Elder Cusiatao,
            the ZL, with some interesting news. He told me that he was with my
            future comp in Cochabamba and that that next thursday I needed to come
            pick him up. Then the weirdest part. He told me that I was going to be
            his trainer. His name is Elder Pinta and he is from Columbia. He is 22
            and had visa problems, so he stayed in the Bogota North mission for 3
            weeks. Now he is here, and I am is trainer. Meaning, I have to be
            senior comp, teach him, and be incharge. I am still nervous at times,
            but he knows a lot so he doesnt need much training. Thursday was my
            first day with him. We went out with an Hermana from the ward, taught
            a good lesson with a less active and set up appointments. Friday and
            Saturday were kinda iffy, but we did find an old guy named Fredy who
            is interested and stuff, as well as teaching an old investigator.
            Saturday afternoon we ate with a member and her nonmember german
            husband. The food was ok, but the best part was the house. Just see
            the pictures to understand. Sunday we went around knocking doors,
            having people tell us funny lies such as... Is ___ here? No she left.
            Where to? The street. Wow, creative lie. We did contact one lady that
            lives in a super rich building, and also had a good lesson with Rut.
            She is the neighbor of Hna Vicky, and about a month and a half ago we
            gave a blessing to her daughter who was pretty sick (she healed up a
            few days later. Coincedence... I think not) Anyways, the lesson went
            well and Hna Vicky said she thinks she is interested. Hopefully it all
            goes well. We need a good investigator. So ya, that sums it all up. I
            am a dad, in the mission sense. I will almost for sure be here until
            January now, but that is ok. Our ward mission leader came back from
            Peru, so that should help a lot. Also a new family moved in with 3
            young men, basically doubling how many we had before. Life is good,
            weird I have almost finished up 5 months. It is actually a long time,
            but it has gone fast. A little over a month until Christmas, so
            that´ll be fun. <br><br>Sounds like all is well. Say hi to everyone and tell
            grandma I want a tart the first day I get back. See you soon...ish.
            <br><br>Love,<br>
            Elder Bagley</small></p>
