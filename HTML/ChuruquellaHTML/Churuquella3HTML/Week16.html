            <h1>Week 16 <small>(November 18, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>It´s a Boy!</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family<br>
            First things first. Happy Birthday Dadio! Hope you are hittin up
            the clubs or partying hard on your birthday...or just having a nice
            day with the family. I feel like every week changes so much for me
            now. Week one with Supayabe, 2 in Cocha, 3 without comp, and 4...
            something we werent expecting. I will get to that later. So for last p
            day, we just did nothing. Tuesday I got to go out with 2 other elders
            in my zone. Elder Sanchez from La Paz and Elder Bartel from Idaho.
            They came over to my area to help me out a bit with my dead area. We
            taught a couple lessons and they taught me a lot of stuff. Wednesday I
            went with Elder Espina and Elder Harris. It was ok I guess. I liked
            spending time with them cause they are like my best friends in the
            mission. We didnt accomplish much, but it was still fun. Espina was in
            a verbal arguement with someone that wouldnt let us talk to his sister
            who was semi interested. Then we just watched a movie with a recent
            convert. That night was interesting. I was in the middle of a prayer
            when the phone rang. I finished and answered. It was Elder Cusiatao,
            the ZL, with some interesting news. He told me that he was with my
            future comp in Cochabamba and that that next thursday I needed to come
            pick him up. Then the weirdest part. He told me that I was going to be
            his trainer. His name is Elder Pinta and he is from Columbia. He is 22
            and had visa problems, so he stayed in the Bogota North mission for 3
            weeks. Now he is here, and I am is trainer. Meaning, I have to be
            senior comp, teach him, and be incharge. I am still nervous at times,
            but he knows a lot so he doesnt need much training. Thursday was my
            first day with him. We went out with an Hermana from the ward, taught
            a good lesson with a less active and set up appointments. Friday and
            Saturday were kinda iffy, but we did find an old guy named Fredy who
            is interested and stuff, as well as teaching an old investigator.
            Saturday afternoon we ate with a member and her nonmember german
            husband. The food was ok, but the best part was the house. Just see
            the pictures to understand. Sunday we went around knocking doors,
            having people tell us funny lies such as... Is ___ here? No she left.
            Where to? The street. Wow, creative lie. We did contact one lady that
            lives in a super rich building, and also had a good lesson with Rut.
            She is the neighbor of Hna Vicky, and about a month and a half ago we
            gave a blessing to her daughter who was pretty sick (she healed up a
            few days later. Coincedence... I think not) Anyways, the lesson went
            well and Hna Vicky said she thinks she is interested. Hopefully it all
            goes well. We need a good investigator. So ya, that sums it all up. I
            am a dad, in the mission sense. I will almost for sure be here until
            January now, but that is ok. Our ward mission leader came back from
            Peru, so that should help a lot. Also a new family moved in with 3
            young men, basically doubling how many we had before. Life is good,
            weird I have almost finished up 5 months. It is actually a long time,
            but it has gone fast. A little over a month until Christmas, so
            that´ll be fun. <br><br>Sounds like all is well. Say hi to everyone and tell
            grandma I want a tart the first day I get back. See you soon...ish.
            <br><br>Love,<br>
            Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <p>12: I finally got some work done! Today I went with Elder Sanchez and Elder Bartel. We ended up finding a bit of success. We went to an area I've never been to, and found 3 new investigators and had 3 lessons. They helped me a lot to understand and learn more about knocking doors. It is a thing I am worst at, finding new people. We also got an appt. with Roxana after a while, so that was good. There're people out there that need the gospel, they just don't know it yet. Oh well, today wasn't awful for once.
                        <br><br>
                        13: And as soon as I have a good day, I get shot back down. Today was downright awful. Today I was with Elder Espina and Elder Harris. 3 appts fell through, we couldn't get a solid lesson, and I even lost one of the investigators from yesterday as Espina kinda got mad at her brother and it just didn't work out. The only good thing was we watched a video with Hna. Sandra and I feel like it helped her. It is starting to get frustrating not getting anything good in the area right now. I might just have to revamp how I do things. I feel like I'm trying, there just aren't any fruits.

                      <p>14: I HAVE A COMPI!!! So last night I got a call from Elder Cusiatao telling me I have a comp. He came this morning. Elder Pinta from Colombia. I have to train him. I just barely finished my training, so I'm a little nervous. He is pretty cool though. 22yrs old, but he's a good missionary. We didn't have success in #s today, but I felt good about it. Had Madeline with us all day. She came with us to teach Bolivia, and it went well. We also tried to help her into member missionary work, and I think she is gonna start doing it. We also had an appt fall through, but then she texted us to tell us say sorry, and walks to talk still. Overall, good day I guess.
                        <br><br>
                        15: Well, today actually turned out well. We started with all of our meetings. I got 12 letters from DearElder. Then we went to lunch, the home to study. I heard all of Pinta's life story, and we decided on being more obedient. Like it says in the scriptures, when we do what the Lord wants, he is obligated to bless us. We also had some success. We met a guy named Fredy, and he wants to come to church. Also, a good lesson with Miguel Leon about being an example. Finally, with Dennys. We taught the Plan of Salvation, and put a baptism date. Hope is all works out, he's great.

                      <p>16: Today was so-so. Some good things happened, but it was boring. We had english classes which were iffy. Then we had lunch with Hna Rosa and Klaus, a german guy that isn't a member but comes to church. Their house is HUGE! IT is a restaurant, hotel, and a house. Pictures were the only way to describe it. Then we had a lesson with Fabiola, the friend of Madeline. It was good and she might be able to make progress. Finally, after having everything fail, we taught the Flia Plaza. We gave them a BoM and the challenge to give it to someone this week. Hopefully success comes from that. Overall, decent enough day.
                    <br><br>
                    17: Sunday #22<br>Today was just interesting. Went to church like normal. No one came so that sucks. 2 goods things did happen though. First, Rodrigo is back. After 2 months in Peru he is back to save the obra misional. 2nd, a new family (Bishop's brother) is moving into the ward, and they're in my area, and they have 3 young men. We had 2 lessons today. First with Fredy, a guy we met yesterday or the day before. He's cool, but just like all old people he likes talking. Then, after we contacted someone that lives in the really big building by us, we taught Rut. It was good. We got help from Hna. Vicky, Hno. Fredy, and Hna Patty. I definitely felt that spirit when talking about having my grandparents watching over me. Overall, I had more lessons this week than the last 3 combined. Progress!</p>

                      <p>18: This cambio has been terrible for p-days. We haven't done anything. My only good one was when I was in Cocha. Not much to say about today. Just kinda hung around and did nothing. I hope one day we actually do something. At night we did have a good FHE though. It was with the Flia. Arce. They are really nice people and want to help in the work of salvation. Only problem is when they keep talking about how cool Tarija and Bermejo (they're from there) are, cause it makes me sad they aren't part of the mission. Not sure how this week is going to turn out, but hopefully we find success.</p>
