            <h1>Week 6 <small>(September 9, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>1 down, 15 to go</h3>
            <p><small>Fam bam,<br>
Como estás? This week was definitely the fastest one that I have had.
Not to say that it was fast, but I wasnt constantly looking down at my
watch to see what time it was. I am trying to be more engaged as
opposed to going through the motions. Anyways, as the title says, 1
down, 15 to go. I finished my first cambio (transfer). Finally I feel
like I have made some progress. As expected, I am staying in Sucre. It
was 110% sure that I was staying. Lopez is staying too, so no change
there. Here is the layout of Sucre. There are 2 zones, 4 districts.
Each district has 8 people. We always do stuff as all of sucre though.
In our district, the only person leaving is Elder Mickle, the other
gringo that lives with us. This means that probably we´ll get a newbie
in the apartment, so I wont be the newest anymore. Other than that,
the only change is that our zone leader is going, and his replacement
was the secretary for the president, so he knows what he is doing.
Here are some other things that happened this week.<br>
1. The package came. It was great to get that t shirt. It is awesome.
The food is also good. I had pop tarts and milk for breakfast one day,
just like the good old days.<br>
2. I gave my first blessing in spanish... I give myself a B-, but it
isnt my spanish that counts, it is the blessing. It was to Gabriel, a
lil 9 year old kid that is cool. He had an ear infection though, so we
gave him a blessing. I sealed the annointing and stuff. It was cool<br>
3. My first really unsuccessful day was wednesday. We walked around
Rumi Rumi for 3 hours, and didnt teach a lesson. It was really
dissappointing, but those things happen in the mission<br>
4. We went to teach Ataualpa and Claudia, the people that the police
are looking for, again. They were fairly normal, but you can tell that
something is bugging them, like the law...<br>
5. It is weird, even at the CCM, I didnt really like scripture study,
but now I love it. I was reading in Alma the other day, and Alma 26 is
like a victory speech by Ammon i think, and it is awesome. I read it
twice just cause. Alma 17 11 is like a mission starting scripture, and
Alma 26 is good to finish it.<br>
6. I get pretty cranky if I am not in bed by 10 30. Lopez doesnt quite
grasp time, so there are times where we dont finish planning until 10
or 1030, and I am not in a good mood. I need to try to be happier
though. }<br>
7. We found a new family on Sunday. Actually, we had some solid
success in tracting this week. 9 new investigators is the most we have
had. We will see how it all goes. The new family is great. They were a
reference from Hma Sandra, a recent convert. Her, maria, and Hector
came with us to teach. It is great when we can have Hector bare his
testimony, when he isnt a member... yet.<br><br>

Investigators that are progressing...<br>
Hector<br>
  Kid is great. He comes to church the whole time, he helps us with
other investigators, and he knows it is all true. We are hoping to
have his baptism on the 21st. The change he has had between the first
lesson and now is night and day. Testimony building for sure.<br>
Familia Leon<br>
  They are good too. Not perfect, but they are progressing. They all
want to be baptized I think, the problem is getting them to church.
People are lazy here and church starts at 8, so it is tough. We expect
the family of 5 to get baptized eventually, just need to get them to
come to church<br><br>

Ultimately, the problem is always coming to church. People work all
week, and sunday is for sleeping, washing clothes, and playing soccer.
People pray and read, they just dont come to church.
Anyways, this week was solid. Glad to be finishing my first cambio.
Spanish is still coming along, not perfect or anywhere near it, but I
try. I find myself thinking in spanish sometimes, and that is weird.
Hope all is going well back home. Church is still true and it always
will be. Bolivia is great, but different and I have grown a lot. I
guess this is it until Monday. Hasta Lunes<br><br>

Elder Bagley<br><br>

Here are some fun Bolivian differences<br>
1. They put corn on pizza, and it is actually good<br>
2. When you finish a meal, you says gracias, and everyone says
provecho, which means something like enjoy it... even though you are
done eating. Dont understand<br>
3. 80% of the cars have names. David, Juan, Reybuchan, weird stuff. No
one really knows why, but the cars always have name stickers<br>
4. The houses are always brick, and for some reason they usually only
paint the front. Lazy<br>
5. Cars are impatient, and honk always. Every corner they honk so no
one stops them.<br>
6. For spanish, if something starts with R or has a RR, it is a Z sound<br>
7. They dont have time really. Church starts 10 minutes late even<br>
8. It really is rice and potatoes and potatoes and rice<br>
9. Cholitas. It is a cultural thing for some women to be cholitas.
They usually just speak Quechua, they always always have braided hair,
they poop on the ground at times, and they can carry like 100 pounds
easy on their packs. Youll see 60 year old women carry 100lb bags of
rice up flights of stairs like it is nothing. The music of the cholita
is haunting too. They are like the witches of Bolivia</small></p>

                      <p>76/100<br><br>I went into today telling myself it was gonna be a good day, and it actually turned out alright. We started out at a service project, moving like 1000 bricks. First we passed them, which looked cool, but it was slow, so then we just carried them. Then we had lunch and went to Hna. Miriam's to download music, but turns out only 1 of the 5 songs was in the right format. We went to Rumi Rumi later and first had a lesson with Mateo, the son of Katy Perez. He is 13, cool I guess, but he talks with his mouth closed and says he sees ghosts... After that we taught Delina. We went to teach Marcela Leon and Gorki too. That went well. I knew to teach about prayer, but I didn't know what scripture, show I brought up the topic and told them Lopez would explain. Finally, after getting some bread, we taught Ana and Ifrain, minus Ifrain. We taught them (Ana, Joel, and Gabriel) about applying scriptures. At the end I had to give my first blessing in Spanish. I'd give myself a B-. It'll get better. Overall, decent day, can't complain.</p>

                        <p>60/100<br><br>I guess what Kanye West says in "Homecoming" is true. "Ya never really know what ya got till it's gone". I didn't realize we had been having success until we had little today. We were in Rumi Rumi for 2 1/2 hrs and had nothing. Probably walked 3ish miles just there. After we kinda picked up a new investigator, got rejected a little bit, and walked some more. We talked with Pablo Resamano, a very less active. Problem with him is he is prideful with his knowledge and all the books he has read. He doesn't really have an opinion, just what he has read. He'll be tough to crack. He also told us the USA might go to war with Syria... kinda scary. Finally after having an appointment with the Familia Leon fall through, we talked with Hma. Sandra. It was good to sit for a second, and have a bit of success. She also said that she has seen a good change in Hector recently. Overall, today made me thankful for the success that we've had, and that if we do have success, another benefit is I don't have to walk as much.</p>

                        <p>73/100<br><br>Finished hump day. Thursdays are right in the middle of the week, so once I finish it, the week is ending. Today was pretty good I guess. It is weird, in the CCM, I didn't really like studying. Now, it's the best. Alma 26 is a ridiculously awesome chapter. I'm also reading Jesus the Christ. I have to study, cause it makes me excited to work. Today we did some tracting. We ended up finding 3 new people, which is really good. One I picked the door, which always boosts my confidence that I can follow the spirit. We also almost climbed all of Churuquella hill. Awesome view. We ran into a drunk guy, and he got mad at us, so that was funny. Finally we had a lesson with Hector. He's doing great, keeps his commitments, is interested, it is great. I feel like he will be my first baptism. Overall, today was pretty good. I feel like I am gradually progressing to be a good missionary. Only 5 days left in my first cambio. Everyone says the 1st one is the worst, so I'm almost done with the hardest part of my mission. Woohoo</p>

Lopez just doesn't get time, and when we don't finish planning until 10:30, I'm just cranky. Today was actually pretty good though. District and Zone meetings, I got my first package, pretty good stuff. We went to Rumi Rumi 2 different times cause we didn't plan very well. We had 3 lessons there though. We came back and taught Ana and Ifrain. They are great and always give us food. Finally we taught Miguel, Micaela, Brianca, and Gorki Leon the Plan of Salvation. They seemed pretty into it, and Gorki just always understands. Overall, good day, it just ended bad cause we finished late. Short entry today cause I'm tired. Oh well...<br>Side note: Sunsets here are awesome.<br>Side note 2: got a cool Moon Lake t-shirt in my package.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>78/100<br><br>Today went by fairly quickly. We started with empanadas, good day. We then went to do service with Mickle, Espina, Muñoz, and Cedano. We stopped by the cemetary first, and the Sucre Cemetary is just awesome. We moved bricks and stuff for service. We had lunch with Sandra, Hector, and Maria. Their family is great, and they like me too. After that we went to an appointment, and it fell through. It looked like we had nothing from 4-7. We ended up teaching Brianca Leon, then Micaela Leon. Good lessons and what not. We also stopped to talk to Hmo. Fredy. I guess the owner might sell the big house, and that could be a problem for Fredy and his family who live there. That sucks cause I like them. We went to teach Claudia and Ataualpa for the first time in weeks. She still seems interested, but you can tell there is something bothering them, like an illegal business or something... anyways, decent day, we got back on time, some I'm not cranky. First week of September over, and it was definitely the fastest week yet.</p>

                        <p>Sunday #12<br>77/100<br><br>Wow, last Sunday of my first transfer. Actually not an awful awful 6 weeks, except for like the first 2 weeks. Overall, not too bad. We learned tonight that Elder Mickle is leaving. Probably gonna get a new gringo, so I won't be the youngest anymore. Sundays are actually kinda long. Only had Hector at Church today, but Hector is doing great. I feel that in 2 weeks I'll have my first baptism. After church, and when Miguel (english speaking) didn't show up, we ate lunch with Madeline and Magdelina, who are great and funny. After that we went with Sandra and her family to a reference. Reuban, Raquel, Denis, and Kevin. Denis is 14 (doesn't look that young) and Kevin is almost 9 (big kid). We had a good lesson with them and hopefully we can make some progress. References are always better than knocking doors, cause they have friends in the church, to keep them active. Definitely ready for p-day, and to start my 2nd transfer.</p>

                        <p>80/100<br><br>P-day, woo! I really like p-days. All the missionaries here are cool and it is fun to hang out with them. This morning I slep in the gym, like always. After that, I was with Elder Cedano for a few hours cause we couldn't find Lope and Muñoz. After internet, which was decent, nothing special, we ate lunch with the zone. After that we just hung out in the Bolivar Plaza, and then went and played futsal. I did pretty well today. I am pretty confident I am the best gringo. It gives me confidence when I do well too. We went to teh house of the pension of Cusiatao and Robertson to get the jacket of Lopez. There, we learned that Elder Muñoz is staying in Sucre, but he is going to the other zone. He was really sad about it. Finally, after an appointment fell through and we sat and taught/listened to Hma. Yolanda, we came back and joked with Espina and Mickle what we're gonna do for a joke for the new guy. Overall, good day. I'm gonna need a new journal soon though.</p>
