            <h1>Week 5 <small>(September 2, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>Por fin, Agosto está terminado</h3>
            <p><small>Mi familia,<br>
   Comó estamos? Whew, this week felt long and short at the same time.
It is like during the week it feels like I am never gonna see the end,
but right now it is weird that I finished it. Anyways, this week was
definitely the most successful. In my first 4 weeks, we had one
investigator at church in total... but yesterday we had five. Hector,
and 4 of the 5 of the familia Leon. It was great. We were late cause
we were trying to get the Leons to come, but we made it. It was fast
sunday too, but you probably know that. Anyways, it was great. Hector
sat with his mom, who was a member, so she helped him. We sat with the
Leon family. After 2 testimonies, Gorki, 12, turned and asked me if he
could go up. I said why not. He is gonna be prophet one day. His
testimony is crazy. One day we went to find his family, and only he
was home. We decided to teach him and challenge him to read. He
described to us later his experience. He prayed with all his heart,
all his conviction, and he said it was something special. He is gonna
be important in the church somewhere. His dad is great too. Kinda slow
if you understand me... but he is great. We challenged him to read the
BoM intro, and he ended up reading half of First Nephi. It was great.
We are definitely expect them all to be baptized. Hector is coming
along great. He is just so happy about church stuff. He went from not
believing in God to coming to church and reading the Bom in like 10
days. I know he will get baptized. We were able to watch the Joseph
Smith movie with him and his family and it was great. He said he
usually only likes action movies, but this one he liked. He is just so
happy about the church. The family and him are our best investigators
right now. We have some others that are good, but those are the best
right now. I am gonna go through the week again...
Monday- we had a ping pong tourney with both zones. I took 4th
somehow. There are a lot of guys here that are really good. Like
really good<br>
Cant remember all the days, whoops, but here are the important events
of the week<br>
1. We were hanging out in Rumi Rumi one day, walking up a hill, and a
lady turns to us and said she needed us, needed help from God. We went
with her and she just kept saying how great we were. She wanted a type
of bible or something... like a BoM. It was a great miracle,
especially since that day we were down cause of few new investigators.<br>
2. I got a closet, or dresser. It is a ropero in spanish. Life is easier now.<br>
3. Camila, hurt her ankle. She is the youngest daughter of our
pensionista. Like Joey´s ankle, but a bit better. She is still super
happy though.<br>
4. We finally started knocking doors this week, cause of the lack of
investigators. It was cool cause we switch off picking doors, and
after a few misses, I picked a random house and we have a return
appointment on friday. At times I don´t trust that I have the spirit,
but it is moments like that that help<br>
5. Saturday we went to Hector´s pre military graduation. Super long,
but it was good to be there with him. It was cool to see how it
worked, but I now know why Bolivia lost to Chile in a war in one
day...<br>
6. Sunday we had a lesson with Miguel Gottlieb. He speaks Spanish,
English, and German. He is a little weird, but smart. We taught like 2
lessons, I taught one in English, and then we taught one in Spanish.
Cool stuff. He said it felt good to talk to us.<br>
7. Elder Lopez has no concept of time...<br>
8. Guess who was sleep talking in Spanish... This guy. Lopez says I
was spouting off spanish in my sleep. Weird, cause I dont feel like I
know that much. Cool stuff though.<br>
9. We have been using the dog dazer. It is fun<br>
I am trying to think of more to say. I am really bad at answering
questions. I am still working on getting adjusted, but there are
moments that make the mission worth it. I am glad to be done with
august. Almost done with the first transfer, one more week. I am
hoping to get more gringos in here. Oh well, that will be all for now.
Baring my testimony in English helped me realize again why I am here.<br>
Tinkuna Cama Familia<br>
Love,<br>
   Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <p>82/100<br><br>Today was pretty good. We had our district and zone meetings today. I've been waiting for a package to come, and we get our mail on tuesdays. Today was tuesday and!... no package still. Oh well. I like the district and zone. Found out the talent show is postponed 3 weeks, so that was a bummer. During the afternoon we knocked doors. We ended up finding a less active member and her friend to teach. Later we went to Rumi Rumi. We talked to Luis Fernando, a teenager. He seems ready to go if he receives an answer. He's a cool kid. Best part of the day: Walking up the street in Rumi Rumi, this lady stops and says she needs our help cause we're men of God. She is having a hard time with her marriage and other stuff and needs help from God. I said the opening prayer and she just started crying. She kep asking for us to leave some sort of "bible"... like the Book of Mormon. She is a little strange, but it sounds like she was looking for us and God put us in her path. Later, we got Ambar, along with Luis Fernando, to commit to baptism. Overall a day of miracles and such. I'm tired, but today was rewarding.</p>

                        <p>80/100<br><br>I'm tired. Elder Lopez is a great comp. The only things that bother me are #1 when he laughs really hard it is like a cackle. #2 is he has no concept of time. We didn't finish planning tonight until 10:30 cause he was talking to everyone. Don't get me wrong, he's great, he just has no clock. Other than that he's great, good as they get. Today was pretty good. We had lunch with Hmo. Fredy and family. I can now do 2/3 of a rubik's cube cause of E' Cedano's help. After we went to Rumi Rumi and didn't have much success. Later we watched the Joseph Smith movie with Hma. Sandra, her friend, Maria, and Hector watch too which was good. Even is Spanish the movie is still powerful. We went to Ana and Ifrain's house. I played with the kids Gabriel and Joel while Lopez helped Ifrain with his Institute homework. Ifrain is one of the humblest people I've ever met. Finally we went back to teach Hector. Taught him about the restoration and asked him to pray about it. He committed to baptism and to come to church. He's great and I really feel like he is gonna progress.</p>

                        <p>70/100<br><br>So yesterday I mentioned how it bothered me that E' Lopez has no concept of time. It's bothering me again. We had a lesson with Hma Estella at about 8:30. We finished the lesson at about 9:15. Great, 45 minutes, that's fine, problem is when we don't leave until 9:40 cause Lopez likes to talk. I brought it up in comp inventory, but still... just venting cause I can't vent to anyone else. Anyways, today was ok. Normal in the morning. After lunch we were with Hma. Vicky and Camila, who hurt her ankle. We ren into Hna. Miriam and her daughter Patty at the Plaza de 25 de Mayo. Patty knows a lot of medical stuff, so she helped Camila. We went to find the familia Leon, but only found Miguel Jr. We were about to leave, but I felt like we could teach him. We ended up getting a baptismal date and I think he'll be prophet one day cause he is super spiritual. We talked with Delina, Hna. Wilma, and her husband, and Hma Patty too. Overall, decent day, but I really wanna be done with August.</p>

                        <p>75/100<br><br>Today had just about a little of everything. Went to breakfast, found out somehow ended up at a viewing. Came home to find my closet or dresser, it's a ropero in spanish. Made the week. It just makes things easier. After lunch we had to walk to a house that was very far away to deliver a book. Then we came back and studied for a bit. Later we went tracting. We tried to go to the big nice building near us, but we were too intimidated. We did end up finding 1 new investigator. We are going back on Friday, so hopefully it goes well. We went to teh chapel to start working on an advertisement for the talent show. We went tracting after that and had no success and I finally saw people mad. Used the dog dazer which makes dogs react funny. Finally, we had a lesson with Miguel and Marcela Leon. Miguel has read like half of 1st Nephi and remembers a lot. He likes the historical side, we just need more spiritual stuff. They're gonna progress, I just know it. Overeall, basically eveerything today.<br><br>2020 Olympics: Rumi Rumi   The :i"s are cholitas</p><br><br>

                        <p>75/100<br><br>Finally, August is over. Finished an actual month as an actual missionary in the field. Fast/slow, hard to explain. Today was kinda long. Today we went to Hector's pre-military graduation. It was kinda cool to see how it all worked, but it was hot and there was a lot of people. The way back was fun with an over packed micro and an incompetant taxi driver. I got to annoint oil again, so that was cool Can't really remember what else happened. We taught Miguel Leon Sr. and Jr. I'm pretty sure we've taught almost every possible combination of the family, just not all 5 at once. Miguel Jr, Gorki, who'll be prophet one day, definitely got spiritual confirmation that the church is true. Hopefully we will have the whole family, Hector, Luis Fernando, Ambar, and Delina at church tomorrow. We talked to Ifrain and his family. We talked about loving our families. Lopez started talking about his dad, and I saw Gabriel smile at his dad. Made me think of my dad. I know this mission makes him so proud and that is something that keeps me going. Apparently, I was sleep talking in spanish last night! Nothing major, but it is something cool.</p>

                        <p>Sunday #11<br><br>I is tired. Sundays for some reason are tiring, probably because the chapel is at the bottom of a big hill, like a really big hill, so each Sunday we have to go up it at least twice. Today was the most successful Sunday. We had 5 investigators at church, Hector, Miguel Leon, Gorki, Brianca, and Micaela (not sure on the spelling). That was more than I've had my entire mission. Gorki even shared his testimony. He's like a spiritual giant. I think that they all liked church. I think we'll get progress with all of them. After church we taught Miguel Gottlieb for like an hour and a half. I talked a lot... in english, but I think it helped. He said he felt something, so we might get somewhere. Later in the day we went with Hma. Vicky to the doctor. She is like my dad, just works no matter what. She is just tired. She needs to rest. Finally we taught Hector. He is doing really well. Wants to know and enjoys it. Today was aight, but I really need a p-day. Baring my (with Miguel Gottlieb) testimony helped me realize why I'm here, cause I'm sharing my happiness.</p>

                        <p>75/100<br><br>P-day. Still is the best day of the week. Not sure if it should be, but it is. Today was alright. We ate with Elders Cedano and Muñoz with Hma. Vicky. I felt kinda sick, went to the bathroom and discovered the water wasn't working... it was a bit stinky in there for a while. We went to internet. Always great to talk to the family. Pictures wouldn't upload though. Everything is great with everyone. I got a letter from Elder Boyd, the old comp of E' Lopez. Good advice. Later we went with Muñoz/Cedano to make lunch with Hma. Vicky. I took a good nap after. Finally we went to play futsal. I did ok I guess. It was funny cause some of the gringos don't know I played, so I can suprise people. I scored a cool goal when Elder Tapia headed it to me, and I turned and scored. I also liked talking with Elder Weekes, Elder Singer, and Elder Robertson. We watched the best 2 years for FHE. Seeing the change Elder Rogers has made me realize I can change, it is just all about the attitude. I'm in charge of how I feel.</p>
