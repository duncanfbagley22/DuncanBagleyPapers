            <h1>Week 12 <small>(October 21, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>I´m going through changes (pretty sure that is a line from a song)</h3>
            <p><small>Dearest family,<br>
            How goes it back home? I am doing swell. First, I will talk about
            the thing that is on everyone´s mind...Cambios. This is whats up. I am
            staying in my area, so no change there. Elder Lopez is headed up to
            Cocha, he is going to train again, and he is going to open an area. He
            leaves Tuesday morning. It´s gonna be really weird to have a different
            companion. My new comp is... drumroll... Elder Supayape from Santa
            Cruz again. I am going to know more about Santa Cruz than Cochabamba.
            I really know nothing about Supayape (soo pa ya pay). Hopefully he
            turns out good. We will see wednesday. Finally I am a regular
            missionary, not being trained or anything. Other significant change is
            that Elder Cedano is leaving to Cocha too. He is our current DL and is
            going to be comps with my buddy Elder Harwood from the CCM. Not sure
            what his replacements name is, but apparently he is a bit flojo, lazy.
            Elder Long will be his comp, and he is perfect for lazy people. That
            is all for cambios, so you can rest for 6 weeks. Other things that
            happened this week that were good.<br>
            English Classes
            Me and Elder Long finally started teaching our english classes,
            tuesday night. 7 people showed up and it went descent enough. Now the
            goal is just transition into actually teaching the people lessons.
            Saturday we had another english class, this time in the morning. One
            of Elder Longs investigators is an english teacher, so she invited the
            whole class. We had about 20 teenage girls there to learn english, and
            I think it went well. Teaching takes a lot out of me, and it gave me a
            lot more respect for what Rachel does.<br>
            Less Actives
            We have been really actually pretty good with less actives. Right
            now we are focused on 3 families.<br>
            Daniela and Alison
            2 little girls that just moved in upstairs from our house. They
            were baptized a year ago, and just moved to Sucre, so they hadnt found
            the church. They seem like they´ll keep going and be solid Young Women<br>
            Familia Plaza
            This is one of my favorite families in the ward. We teach them a
            lot, and they probably pretty much are active now, so that is good.
            Elder Lopez had a hard time leaving them last night cause we are so
            close. They are super humble and just love us.<br>
            Javier
            He is the younger brother of the 2nd counselor. He is super cool.
            He is a pro dancer and teaches dancing school. He is super humble and
            knows it is true, and tells us all the time. He has a kid with his
            ´´wife´´ more or less, but they dont live together. She is very
            catholic, but maybe with time she´ll open up.<br><br>
            
            As far as investigators go, here are the really good ones right now.
            Dennys
            He is hector´s friend and has come to church the last 4 or 5 times.
            He likes us, but is just waiting to receive his answer. He will get
            baptized eventually, it is just a matter of time. We are basically
            just waiting till he gets the answer he needs that it is the true
            church.<br>
            Nancy and Roberto
            They are viejos, meaning they are old. They are super catholic, but
            they really like us. At first they just liked that we talk about the
            bible, but now they are starting to get the real point. We have
            noticed that Nancy has taken down all her little figurines of little
            saints and baby jesus and the virgen. The problem with them is that
            they really dont wanna leave the catholic church, as it is part of
            their life. I think they know it is true, they just need a little
            push. We have been chipping away and it looks like we could get
            somewhere.<br>
            Roxana
            She is the lady we ran into with the miracle when Lopez was walking
            like crazy to end up at that house. She has a tumor, but doesnt know
            if it is cancerous or not. She is really humble and says we are
            angels. Again, super catholic. We will keep working with her and
            hopefully she gets somewhere.
            <br><br>
            That is it for the work. Our 2nd ward mission leader just moved, so
            now we are looking for a 3rd. We did go to that castle thing last
            week. I will attach pictures later of it. It was cool and we even left
            a pamphlet with the tour guide. Today we went to 7 cascadas
            (waterfalls). It was pretty cool. Me Elder Long Elder Harris and Elder
            Cedano hiked a bit farther up to see more of the waterfalls. It was so
            hard not to jump in the water, cause it was super blue and today was
            hot. Anyways, that is it for this week. I finished up 4 months last
            week, and also my 3 cambio overall. Hopefully, me and Supayape will
            get some more work done and big things will start happening in
            Churuquella. That is all for this week.<br><br>
            Que les vayan bien (that is what you say when you leave people)<br>
            Elder Bagley<br><br>
            P.S We found that we had a mouse running around the apartment, so last
            night we set out to kill it. Lopez finally got it with a broom stick
            somehow. I basically hate all animals now aside from pigs</small></p>
