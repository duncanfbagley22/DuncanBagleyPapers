            <h1>Week 9 <small>(September 30, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>Done with September</h3>
            <p><small>Himainaya Familia,<br>How is erthing in the 801? This week was an interesting one. Ups
and low downs. Not too awful, but it was tough at times. I am just
gonna go through all the days, cause that way there is a less chance
that I am gonna miss something. Tuesday was... the worst day of the
week, but I learned a lot. The beginning of this week we had a solid
plan. Talk to more people, study more, get references... We were
ready. Problem was, I think I was a little too focused on the numbers.
So... Tuesday came. We left at 2, and came back home at 9. We didnt
have a single bit of success in that entire day. We sat down a total
of 10 minutes maybe. Walking all around town, appointments falling
through, people shutting the door in our faces. It made me realize
that the mission isnt so easy. We came back home just destroyed. To
not have a single lesson or new investigator in a day is the absolute
worst. We knelt down to pray for our daily planning, and Lopez said a
great prayer. He just prayed for help. No one wants to hear from us or
accept us, but we know the truth. It made me remember a talk by Elder
Holland, that when we are rejected and such, we are standing at the
Savior´s side. Also, DyC 121:7 I think it is came to mind. Wednesday
came, also hard. Until 6 we had nothing. It isnt that we dont work, it
is just no one listens. All of the sudden, Elder Lopez just darted
off. I followed, cause that is what we do. We went about 10 or 15
blocks, like a 20min walk. He came up to this house, looking
confident. I asked who lived here, cause I know a less active lives
near there, and he said he had no idea. We knocked and a lady named
Roxana answered. She let us in, weird, and just listened to
everything. It was awesome. She said she had prayed for help or an
answer or something, and she is pretty sure we are it. It was the
miracle we needed. Lopez cant guess like that, no one can. The spirit
gave us the direction we needed. I just gave him a big hug after cause
we were so happy. Other than that, the thing that is the best this
week is the Medina family. They are a reference from Hna Sandra and
Hector. So far, the best success has been with Dennys. He is 14, looks
20, and is friends with Hector. He comes to church all the time and is
great. Once he gets his answer that this is THE church, he´ll be
baptized. We are looking at the 12th. His little brother Kevin is
awesome. Barely 8, looks 11, and he is a goofball. He always gives us
hugs though and prays and stuff. We introduced him to the members at
church yesterday as the Future Elder Medina. We are working with the
parents, but slowly. The mom, Raquel, thinks she should come to church
now cause of the positive change she has seen in the life of Hector,
Dennys, and Hna. Sandra. Other than them, investigators are slowly
coming. We are going to get a reference soon from the Fam Plaza, the
coolest people. We might play volleyball and have FHE to start the new
investigators. Also, at the house of Hna Vicky last night, her
neighbor came by and asked for a blessing for her daughter. We gave
her one and I think we are going to return to start teaching her.
Also, I am starting to not be too fond of the Catholic traditions
here. We have 2 investigators, Nancy and Roberto, that believe
everything we say, the problem is they are reluctant to leave their
catholic heritage. The have all their saints and stuff. It is
exhausting to try and break through. Also, last night, we had a lesson
with a less active member that doesnt believe in the BoM. Not sure how
you can be baptized without that. I wanna talk to those
missionaries... Anyways, we try to teach her about praying about it,
but she thinks her answer comes from BBN, this Bible radio station. I
got frustrated, cause she is sending like 20 dollars to them as
´´tithing´´. People here cant afford that. I left 2 chapters of the
bible about the BoM Ezekial 37 and Isaiah 29, but she probably wont
understand, seeing as she told us they broadcast the radio from
Bogota...in the USA. Anyways, this week was hard, but it went fast.
The thing that is becoming crucial for us is references. One of those
is better than 100 doors. So if you have anyone to introduce, do it.
It is their salvation at stake. Read Jacob 1:19 for a little push.
Anyways, spanish is still pretty solid. I find myself forgetting if
something is said in English or Spanish, I often think or count in
Spanish, and when I talk to Elder Harris in English at night, spanish
slips out. I still prefer english, but spanish is comfortable. Elder
Lopez is still great. He will probably be transferred the next cambio,
so thatll be weird. He doesnt expect a visa until maybe next summer.
Everything else is great. Hope everything is going well in the states.
Weird I have almost been gone as long as Rachel was in New Zealand.
Church is truer, if that is possible. I am excited for General
Conference, aka P Weekend, because it is 10 hours of English doctrine.
Itll be great. Anyways, Tinkuna Cama.<br>
   Love, Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <p>60/100<br><br>24: Well... today was hard. Felt like I did everything right. Got up on time, exercised even. Studied and stuff. We had the whole agenda filled, back up plans too. Turns out, we had 6+ hours of straight walking with nothing. Dozens of doors and people talked to, but nothing. I don't feel too bad, cause I tried my best the whole day. Lopez said a great prayer that was so true. No one wants to hear us, but we'll keep going till we find that one person. It is a test of our faith. Discouragement isn't stopping us. Nothing can.<br><br>75/100<br><br>25: Ok, today was a lot better. We still are walking a bunch, but we found some people today. It felt so good to find people that would listen. I thought Job 23:10 went well with our situation. We went around with the list of members in the ward we didn't know. We didn't find any of them, but it helped get us to new people to teach. We also talked with Pablo Resamano, and then taught Hna. Sandra about FHE. Tody was just good to get the monkey off our back. Getting a lesson was a huge relief. This week has been humbling. I thought everything would be easy, but I always need to trust in the Lord.<br><u>Side note:</u> a little kid was peeing in the street and Lopez went up, rubbed his head, and said "felicitaciones"</p>

                        <p>75/100<br><br>26: Well, we had a cool experience today. Like the last few days, we didn't really have anything in the afternoon. After we left one house, Elder Lopez just started walking. He looked like he had an idea of where we should go, so I just followed. We went from one side of the area to the other. All of the sudden, he just stopped at a house. It seemed like he knew the person that lived there, but he said he had no idea. We knocked on the door, the lady opened the door, and we had a full leasson, feeling the spirit and all. Lopez, through the spirit, knew exactly where to go, and now we have Roxana as an investigator. Testimony booster. If we just work hard and do our part, the Lord will do the rest. 100 days finished.<br><br>70/100<br><br>27: Today was pretty average. We planned with Cedano and Long to have an english class. We taugh a less active member, named Bolivia... from Bolivia. I felt really great about the lesson, and I think she might come to church this week. We also talked with the Plaza family. They actually came to us with the idea for a reference. References are like gold for us. Anyways, almost done with a really hard, but also a useful week for learning.</p>

                        <p>28: Today was ehh... we went to do a service project at the house of the fam. Espejo. Throwing and stacking rocks. It was all good till the rocks all fell down and almost hurt us. Later we had a lesson with Roberto and Nancy. Hno. Guereca came with us. They are super nice people, but difficult to work with cause of how strongly Catholic they are. We keep working I guess. Later appointment after appointment fell through, and apart from going to the big mansion house of Hno. Fredy, the day was awful. I was super discouraged. We had a solid lesson with Dennys, but still a little discouraged. But I just gotta keep going. Christ did.<br><br>Sunday #15<br>29: Well... I don't have any wwhitty opening or anything to say. Today was a decent Sunday. Dennys and Kevin came to church, so that was good. We are starting to make progress with Dennys. We had a good lesson with his mom, Raquel, today. We also talked with Hector about the priesthood. Finally we had a lesson with the Fam Savedra... It bothered me. The wife only believes some dumb biblical radio thing, BBN. She is just so closed, she won't receive any answer cause she thinks every answer is from the radio... Anyways, ready for a new week.</p>

                          <p>30: P-day #? Today was pretty good. We just hung out with the district today. We first did email stuff, which was good today. I guess my family still misses me. Afer that we went to Napolitana, where we had piza for once. It was awesome. Lopez and Cedano had to leave to go do something in Cedano's area, so the rest of us went to the Bolivian Military museum. It was actually pretty cool. Old stuff from different wars. The best was 80 miles worth of letter written by little kids from Bolivia to Chile asking for the ocean back. Anyways, then we just played ping pong and watched videos of Cholitas fighting. Overall, productive day.</p>
