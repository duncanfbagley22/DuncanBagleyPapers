            <h1>Week 11 <small>(October 14, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>Me Robaron</h3>
            <p><small>Dear family,<br>
            How is erbody? I hope all is well back home. I have been really
            trunky lately (that is when you think of home a lot), probably because
            I live with Elder Espina, who finishes up in about a month and a half,
            and I think it is his goal to talk about leaving as much as possible
            just to bug me. I like him though, he is really good at helping us,
            because he has so much time, and me and Lopez have so little. Speaking
            of Lopez, he´ll probably be leaving this week. We find out next Sunday
            night about cambios, so I guess we´ll see. I guess technically I could
            leave too, or we could both stay, but it isn´t likely. It´ll be weird
            if I get a new comp. Anyways, this week was the talent show. All the
            missionaries in Sucre took part in a talent show, with the goal of
            getting investigators and less actives to attend. We ended up getting
            a few people there, so I guess we accomplished the goal. We demolished
            the talent show, in a good way. We discovered Wednesday that no one
            had prepared anything for the show as far as decorations or logistical
            things, so me Lopez Espina and Harris ended up planning the majority,
            even though the leaders should´ve been doing it. We practiced all week
            and it went awesome. I was part of 4 acts...<br>
            Viaje de Terereke: This was our first one, and it went well. I am just
            an extra, but the idea is all of us asked for a ticket to somewhere,
            and then Espina asks if there is a ticket for Terereke (who is Cedano)
            and then he and Lopez fight. It was just a warm up.<br>
            El Robo más rapido del mundo: This one was awesome. I was the main
            guy. I walk through, get slightly hit, and then I act like someone
            robbed me, but it was too quick to see anything. Elder Lopez pauses
            the scene and rewinds it and then we do it in slow mo. In this one,
            because it is in slow mo, you can see everything. Everyone in the
            scene ends up beating me up and even elder Espina dressed as a tiger
            runs up from the crowd. It was really funny.<br>
            Juggling: I did a juggling act and I didnt drop it once. I did a bunch
            of tricks and after a had a lot of little kids following me asking how
            to do it.<br>
            Las Hijas de Ismael: In this one, we did a story of when the sons of
            Lehi are commanded to go marry the daughters of Ismael. The story is
            that the daughters are ugly and we want to marry the daughters of
            Jeremiah. In it I was Nephi, and apparently I was really good at the
            acting. Me, Lopez, Cedano, and Espina were all the sons, and not to be
            prideful, but we acted pretty well. Espina ends up with the ugliest
            wife, because he is Sam.<br>
            Anyways, the show went well. We have it all filmed, so the plan is to
            try to get it up on Youtube, so you guys can watch.<br>
            As far as investigators go, it is slow. We have Dennys, Hectors
            friend, who comes to church every week. Problem is we cant ever get in
            contact to teach him. His parents came to church yesterday and
            hopefully we can get working with the whole family. We also have Nancy
            and Roberto. They are old people that are SUPER catholic, but receive
            us well. I think they realize it is all true, but they are stuck in
            their ways too much. Roberto is even scared to talk to us now cause he
            thinks we´ll baptize him, which we will. We have a few street contacts
            that could go somewhere, but we´ll see. We had a ward counsel
            yesterday and basically called out everyone to help us. The last 10ish
            baptisms in the ward are references, which should show something. We
            really cant accomplish anything without the members, they just need to
            get involved. References are like gold out here. So dad mentioned that
            people in Seth´s mission got sent home. I just wanna mention something
            about this mission. Overall, Cochabamba is probably one of the most
            disobedient missions in the world. There are probably 120 good good
            missionaries in the mission, and about 100 machaneros, or people that
            do bad things. The thing is President Dyer is so nice, and realizes
            that if he sends people home, they arent going to go back to church
            ever. It is a juggling act to try to get people on the right track. It
            is a bit disheartening that missionaries do that, but I just have to
            worry about myself. I dont do anything bad, dont worry. Usually the
            machaneros are kept in Cocha, because President can keep an eye on
            them. There are really good missionaries though. Anyways, this week
            was low in terms of work, but I keep feeling myself wanting to work
            more and more. Please, everyone that reads this, help the
            missionaries. They need it. Every member is a missionary. I will leave
            with a scripture, which basically describes my life right now. It is 3
            Nephi 5:13
            <br><br>
            13 Behold, I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I have
            been called of him to declare his word among his people, that they
            might have everlasting life.
            <br><br>
            I keep going. Almost done with my training, and then I am a real real
            missionary. Keep up the good work. I love you all so much. Help the
            missionaries, keep up the prayers, church is true. Even when people
            are obviously lying to us and screaming and swearing at us (which
            actually does happen), the church is still true.<br>
            Love, Elder Bagley</small></p>
