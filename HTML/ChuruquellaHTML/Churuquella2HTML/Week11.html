            <h1>Week 11 <small>(October 14, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>Me Robaron</h3>
            <p><small>Dear family,<br>
            How is erbody? I hope all is well back home. I have been really
            trunky lately (that is when you think of home a lot), probably because
            I live with Elder Espina, who finishes up in about a month and a half,
            and I think it is his goal to talk about leaving as much as possible
            just to bug me. I like him though, he is really good at helping us,
            because he has so much time, and me and Lopez have so little. Speaking
            of Lopez, he´ll probably be leaving this week. We find out next Sunday
            night about cambios, so I guess we´ll see. I guess technically I could
            leave too, or we could both stay, but it isn´t likely. It´ll be weird
            if I get a new comp. Anyways, this week was the talent show. All the
            missionaries in Sucre took part in a talent show, with the goal of
            getting investigators and less actives to attend. We ended up getting
            a few people there, so I guess we accomplished the goal. We demolished
            the talent show, in a good way. We discovered Wednesday that no one
            had prepared anything for the show as far as decorations or logistical
            things, so me Lopez Espina and Harris ended up planning the majority,
            even though the leaders should´ve been doing it. We practiced all week
            and it went awesome. I was part of 4 acts...<br>
            Viaje de Terereke: This was our first one, and it went well. I am just
            an extra, but the idea is all of us asked for a ticket to somewhere,
            and then Espina asks if there is a ticket for Terereke (who is Cedano)
            and then he and Lopez fight. It was just a warm up.<br>
            El Robo más rapido del mundo: This one was awesome. I was the main
            guy. I walk through, get slightly hit, and then I act like someone
            robbed me, but it was too quick to see anything. Elder Lopez pauses
            the scene and rewinds it and then we do it in slow mo. In this one,
            because it is in slow mo, you can see everything. Everyone in the
            scene ends up beating me up and even elder Espina dressed as a tiger
            runs up from the crowd. It was really funny.<br>
            Juggling: I did a juggling act and I didnt drop it once. I did a bunch
            of tricks and after a had a lot of little kids following me asking how
            to do it.<br>
            Las Hijas de Ismael: In this one, we did a story of when the sons of
            Lehi are commanded to go marry the daughters of Ismael. The story is
            that the daughters are ugly and we want to marry the daughters of
            Jeremiah. In it I was Nephi, and apparently I was really good at the
            acting. Me, Lopez, Cedano, and Espina were all the sons, and not to be
            prideful, but we acted pretty well. Espina ends up with the ugliest
            wife, because he is Sam.<br>
            Anyways, the show went well. We have it all filmed, so the plan is to
            try to get it up on Youtube, so you guys can watch.<br>
            As far as investigators go, it is slow. We have Dennys, Hectors
            friend, who comes to church every week. Problem is we cant ever get in
            contact to teach him. His parents came to church yesterday and
            hopefully we can get working with the whole family. We also have Nancy
            and Roberto. They are old people that are SUPER catholic, but receive
            us well. I think they realize it is all true, but they are stuck in
            their ways too much. Roberto is even scared to talk to us now cause he
            thinks we´ll baptize him, which we will. We have a few street contacts
            that could go somewhere, but we´ll see. We had a ward counsel
            yesterday and basically called out everyone to help us. The last 10ish
            baptisms in the ward are references, which should show something. We
            really cant accomplish anything without the members, they just need to
            get involved. References are like gold out here. So dad mentioned that
            people in Seth´s mission got sent home. I just wanna mention something
            about this mission. Overall, Cochabamba is probably one of the most
            disobedient missions in the world. There are probably 120 good good
            missionaries in the mission, and about 100 machaneros, or people that
            do bad things. The thing is President Dyer is so nice, and realizes
            that if he sends people home, they arent going to go back to church
            ever. It is a juggling act to try to get people on the right track. It
            is a bit disheartening that missionaries do that, but I just have to
            worry about myself. I dont do anything bad, dont worry. Usually the
            machaneros are kept in Cocha, because President can keep an eye on
            them. There are really good missionaries though. Anyways, this week
            was low in terms of work, but I keep feeling myself wanting to work
            more and more. Please, everyone that reads this, help the
            missionaries. They need it. Every member is a missionary. I will leave
            with a scripture, which basically describes my life right now. It is 3
            Nephi 5:13
            <br><br>
            13 Behold, I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I have
            been called of him to declare his word among his people, that they
            might have everlasting life.
            <br><br>
            I keep going. Almost done with my training, and then I am a real real
            missionary. Keep up the good work. I love you all so much. Help the
            missionaries, keep up the prayers, church is true. Even when people
            are obviously lying to us and screaming and swearing at us (which
            actually does happen), the church is still true.<br>
            Love, Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <p>8: Well, we've decided this mission is the most tiras in the world. We said when the apostles are assigning people and things to the missions, anything that is tiras belongs in Cochabamba Bolivia. Today was eh... District meeting. Elder Harris is sick so they stayed home all day. We went to the airport to drop off Elder Long cause he is going to Cocha this week. lesson with Javier, the brother of Hno. Fredy. He is less active, and I think he is just scared to come back to church. Other than that, boring day, nothing cool to report.
                        <br><br>
                        9: My foot hurts a lot. I still have 2 wants I have to treat with acid and it hurts. Today was pretty good. We practiced for our talent show, which is gonna be funny. Later we went looking for more investigators. We just use a lost of members, 97% they don't live there, it just gives us an excuse to talk to people. Today we knew no one on the list lived at a house, but we knocked "looking" for this person. We ended up finding some guy that was nice, so maybe we'll get somewhere with him. We also taught Hector, who is still super solid and we talked to Miguel and Gorki Leon. Overall, solid day.

                        <p>10: I wish I had something cool to report today, but not much. We studied in the morning and all that fun stuff. We had weekly planning, and we've decided that the church in Sucre, apart from a few wards, is just awful. No one helps or does anything. Other than the ward of E' Espina and E' Harris, our ward is one of the worst. It's frustrating. Other than being frustrated, we just downloaded music for the talen show and had lessons fall through and such. Boring day no más
                        <br><br>
                        11: Another boring day. We are really just working on preparing for the talent show, cause no one else is really doing it. We didn't have a lesson today, so nothing to report there. We went to find Roxana (Sept 26). We talked with her last night on the phone, so we figured she would be home. We got there and her cousin answered the door. She immediately said she wasn't there, that we had talked with her sister on the phone, and then she checked the watch (that she didn't have) and then had to "leave". Maybe the worst lie I've heard on my mission. Then we just practiced some more. This talent show better pay off.</p>

                        <p>Today was the talent show, so it deserves an entire page. We started out the day with a service project. We built a slide to pour cement with and also moved a bunch of dirt. It was our whole district, minus E' Long cause he was still in Cocha. So we did that, and then basically just had the talent show the rest of the day. I had a part in 5 acts which were...
                            <br>Viaje de Terereke: I didn't have a major part. The idea was we all asked for a ticket somewhere, and then E' Espina asks for one for Terereke, but Terereke is really just E' Cedano.
                            <br>Juggling: I did a juggling act by myself, and I didn't drop it once. Felt really good.
                            <br>El robo más rápido de mundo: This one I was the main guy. I walk, then get hit by E' Long and E' Cedano. It looks normal, but I say I got robbed. We rewind, and then do it in slow motion. Everyone ends up beating me up, even E' Espina dressed as a tiger. All that stuff you can only see in slow-mo.

                          <p>13: Sunday #17<br>Well today started off different. We got a call from the bishop telling us that a patio in the ward was flooded and we needed to help. So we went and empty water for an hour and a half. It was definitely a memorable experience. Me, Lopez, Long, Cedano, the bishop, and Hno. Fredy were all late for church but for a good cause. After that we had a spicy lunch, I fought with a little kid named Josue and every time I touched his head, he fell over. We had lessons with Hna Sandra and family and a new, less active family that lives upstairs. I'm starting to feel like we aren't productive though, and I wanna change that.

                        14: P-day part 1. Today was an iffy p-day. Everyone is basically out of money, except for me. I have like 200bs more than everyone else cause I use it wisely. Anyways, internet was good, then we played wallyball with the Elders in our district as well as Cusi and Herndon. Then we ate at Napolitana. Me and Long wanted to work at 4, but Cedano and Lopez not so much. I ended up taking a nap. We had a family night with Hna. Vicky. I tried to say a prayer in english, but it is hard. The FHE was good though. That is all, boring day, but a good one just cause it was p-day.</p>
