            <h1>Week 10 <small>(October 7, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>Tomorrow in the Tomorrow</h3>
            <p><small>Sorry that my letter is like 6 hours late this week. We went to
            the Sucre dinosaur park this morning and got back late, then we went
            to lunch with Elder Lopez`s aunt`s mom and then the internet in Sucre
            is just awful sometimes. We are currently in the 4th different place.
            Anyways, this week was pretty interesting. I called it p week, cause
            it kinda was with conference. So Monday after internet we went to the
            war museum of Bolivia. It was cool, but you can see why Bolivia loses
            every war. They import everything and make nothing themselves. The
            best part was 80 miles worth of letters written by Bolivian children
            asking Chile for the coast of the ocean back. It didnt work. We took a
            picture of Elder Espina, who is Chilean, by all the letters with him
            smiling. It was funny. Tuesday was just a normal day. I cant really
            remember what happened, so it cant be that good. Wednesday there was a
            leadership conference, so all the trainers had to go to an all day
            meeting. That means that Lopez had to go. Me, Elder Long, and Elder
            Harris went just us the whole day. Elder Long has 1 more cambio than
            me, and Harris has 1 less, so we were inexperienced. We actually
            taught a whole lesson just the 3 of us, so that was pretty cool. I
            felt confident cause I ended up leading the 3 of us. Thursday brought
            interviews with President Dyer. I really really really really like
            him. He gave me a lot of confidence in the interview. He said that I
            am progressing faster than is normal and that I, according to him and
            elder Lopez, am already a great missionary. I still have a long ways
            to go, but I am progressing. Friday we had to go on an intercambio,
            because we had 2 lessons at 8 one night. I went with Jose Padilla, the
            ward missionary. I did most the talking and even tried to contact
            someone on the street. I was senior companion twice this week and I
            did decent. Saturday started p weekend. We got to watch all 3 sessions
            of conference Saturday and both on Sunday, all in English, and also
            live. Conference is different as a missionary. At home I would hardly
            pay attention, but as a missionary every moment is like gold.
            Conference flew by. I assume the talks I liked are probably the same
            ones that you guys liked. I, like probably everyone, liked Elder
            Uchtdorf`s quote about doubt. Conference was just simply great, and it
            sucks that I have to wait 6 months for the next one. I wish I had more
            to say, but this week was kinda a blur. I got the second package this
            week. It took about 6 weeks, so not too bad. I also got a package from
            Steve Cantwell and Ronnie Lo, so tell them thank you. Also, the ward
            newsletter and a dearelder from Edie. Oh yeah, we also got blessings
            from our Bishop to help us in the ward. We keep trying to work with
            members, but now we are going to make a plan and hopefully something
            starts to happen. We are also going to have a talent show next week to
            try and attract new people and we are going to start teaching english
            starting a week from tuesday. We are going to do everything we can to
            get more people. What I got from Conference mainly was to trust in
            God, the small and simple things are important, and that the members
            need to help, so you guys being members, should try to help as much as
            you can. It brings blessings for you and for everyone, so everyone
            wins. Anyways, the week was good. 2 more weeks till cambios, and me or
            Elder Lopez will probably leave. Life is always getting better.
            Conference made me a bit trunky, but I am ready to get back to work.
            So ya, until monday I guess. Rise up
            <br><br>Elder Bagley
            <br><br>the title is an example of the english of elder Lopez. He said mañana
            en la mañana which means tomorrow in the morning, but he thinks it is
            funny that mañana en la mañana can also theoretically mean tomorrow in
            the tomorrow as well. He also says things like Holy Dinner (santa
            cena) and when I correct him he just tells me I dont speak english.
            Ill miss him when he leaves</small></p>
