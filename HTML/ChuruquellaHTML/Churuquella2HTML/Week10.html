            <h1>Week 10 <small>(October 7, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>Tomorrow in the Tomorrow</h3>
            <p><small>Sorry that my letter is like 6 hours late this week. We went to
            the Sucre dinosaur park this morning and got back late, then we went
            to lunch with Elder Lopez`s aunt`s mom and then the internet in Sucre
            is just awful sometimes. We are currently in the 4th different place.
            Anyways, this week was pretty interesting. I called it p week, cause
            it kinda was with conference. So Monday after internet we went to the
            war museum of Bolivia. It was cool, but you can see why Bolivia loses
            every war. They import everything and make nothing themselves. The
            best part was 80 miles worth of letters written by Bolivian children
            asking Chile for the coast of the ocean back. It didnt work. We took a
            picture of Elder Espina, who is Chilean, by all the letters with him
            smiling. It was funny. Tuesday was just a normal day. I cant really
            remember what happened, so it cant be that good. Wednesday there was a
            leadership conference, so all the trainers had to go to an all day
            meeting. That means that Lopez had to go. Me, Elder Long, and Elder
            Harris went just us the whole day. Elder Long has 1 more cambio than
            me, and Harris has 1 less, so we were inexperienced. We actually
            taught a whole lesson just the 3 of us, so that was pretty cool. I
            felt confident cause I ended up leading the 3 of us. Thursday brought
            interviews with President Dyer. I really really really really like
            him. He gave me a lot of confidence in the interview. He said that I
            am progressing faster than is normal and that I, according to him and
            elder Lopez, am already a great missionary. I still have a long ways
            to go, but I am progressing. Friday we had to go on an intercambio,
            because we had 2 lessons at 8 one night. I went with Jose Padilla, the
            ward missionary. I did most the talking and even tried to contact
            someone on the street. I was senior companion twice this week and I
            did decent. Saturday started p weekend. We got to watch all 3 sessions
            of conference Saturday and both on Sunday, all in English, and also
            live. Conference is different as a missionary. At home I would hardly
            pay attention, but as a missionary every moment is like gold.
            Conference flew by. I assume the talks I liked are probably the same
            ones that you guys liked. I, like probably everyone, liked Elder
            Uchtdorf`s quote about doubt. Conference was just simply great, and it
            sucks that I have to wait 6 months for the next one. I wish I had more
            to say, but this week was kinda a blur. I got the second package this
            week. It took about 6 weeks, so not too bad. I also got a package from
            Steve Cantwell and Ronnie Lo, so tell them thank you. Also, the ward
            newsletter and a dearelder from Edie. Oh yeah, we also got blessings
            from our Bishop to help us in the ward. We keep trying to work with
            members, but now we are going to make a plan and hopefully something
            starts to happen. We are also going to have a talent show next week to
            try and attract new people and we are going to start teaching english
            starting a week from tuesday. We are going to do everything we can to
            get more people. What I got from Conference mainly was to trust in
            God, the small and simple things are important, and that the members
            need to help, so you guys being members, should try to help as much as
            you can. It brings blessings for you and for everyone, so everyone
            wins. Anyways, the week was good. 2 more weeks till cambios, and me or
            Elder Lopez will probably leave. Life is always getting better.
            Conference made me a bit trunky, but I am ready to get back to work.
            So ya, until monday I guess. Rise up
            <br><br>Elder Bagley
            <br><br>the title is an example of the english of elder Lopez. He said mañana
            en la mañana which means tomorrow in the morning, but he thinks it is
            funny that mañana en la mañana can also theoretically mean tomorrow in
            the tomorrow as well. He also says things like Holy Dinner (santa
            cena) and when I correct him he just tells me I dont speak english.
            Ill miss him when he leaves</small></p>

                    <p>1: Wow, I've been in Sucremanta for 2 months now. Still have lots of time left, but I've accomplished a lot. Today was ok. We didn't get started working until 4, but after that was good. We found 2 new investigators, so hopefully at least one pans out. We also had a pretty good lesson with Miguel and Gorki Leon. First time in a while. It was good, Hno. Fredy came with us. We taught about prophets and conferencia (freak, sometimes spanish just comes out) cause it is coming up. Overall, pretty good day. Starting a new month with a pretty good day.</p>

                        <p>2: Well today was a pretty good experience. Today had 3 gringos to teach with me, Elder Long, and Elder Harris because everyone
                        else had a conference. It was a little intimidating to have to be senior companion with being able to rely on a Latino
                        companion. So first we just had a nice chat the 3 of us. After that we had lunch, where I took the role of E' Lopez,
                        bothering Ericka, doing the dishes, etc. Later we actually had a lesson. Me and Long carried a whole lesson on the Plan
                        of Salvation with Ambur. After that we just had just had a regular day (apts. falling) and then me and Lopez had a lesson
                        with Hna. Sandra. Oh yeah met an Austrailian girl with an awesome accent. Overall, good experience to have to carry the
                        load for once.<br><br> 
                        3: Interview day. In the time between my first interview and the one I had today, I have changed so
                        much, a good way. A solid 15 min interview with Pres. Dyer. A few things stuck out: 1) I'm not currently preparing,
                        according to him and Elder Lopez, but I am a great missionary. 2) Best thing cause it made me feel good, he said I am
                        progressing faster than is common. Overall, good interview. Also today, we had a lesson with Gorki and Miguel Leon
                        (they've read up to Alma already). Also with the brother of Hno. Fredy and the Flia Servantes. I've finished around 3 1/2 months now, speed is starting to
                        pick up.</p>

                        <p>4: I got another package! We had a zone meeting today and I got a package from my family, a package from Steve Cantwell and Ronnie Lo, and a DearElder from my aunt Edie. Good day. I also had llama for lunch, which is really good. After that we had a practice for the talent show we're gonna have. It'll be funny. Later we had a lesson with the Flia Plaza and finally we had to split. We had 2 lessons at 8, so I went with Hno. Josh Padilla to teach Dennys who wasn't there. We ended up teaching Raquel for a little bit. I tried to contact a guy on the street, but he didn't want anything of it. Anyway, good day, ready for conference.
                            <br><br>
                            5: GENERAL CONFERENCE. today was a really good day of conference. It is weird looking at conference which is usually just a 10 minute drive away, and realizing I'm thousands of miles away. We watched conference in english which was cool. Conference was a lot better as a missionary. All 3 sessions went really fast. I took notes just cause I wanted to, and I got a lot out of it. We also practiced for the talent show and it is gonna be funny. There are 2 quotes that I really liked today, both from Pres Uchtdorf. 1) "Rise Up" 2) "Doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith" Sad it is more than half over.</p>

                          <p>6: Sunday # 16<br>Darn, conference is over. It was the fastest conference I've had. As a missionary, conference is a lot better. You can apply things a lot better. There was a lot of good talks today. I can't really remember any great quotes, but the things I remember are to trust in the Lord, repent, and the small and simple are important. It is always great to listen tot he prophets. 6 more months until the next one. Other than conference, we just ate lunch and dinner. Wish I had something cooler to say. Church is true still.
                            <br><br>
                            7: P-day, the end of p-weekend. Today was pretty good. We went to the Cretasic (?) park today. It is a dinosaur museum more or less. We got in at a 1/3 of the price, so that was good. It was cool, but small. After that we ate dinner with the mom of Lopez's aut and her other daughter. We went to internet after, but it was so slow today that we didn't finish until 5:30. Found out my grandma broke her femur, so that is kinda scary. After internet I got a haircut, and then we had FHE with Ivana and Adriana. It was pretty good I guess. Overall, I'm ready to just go work hard this week. That's what's important.</p>
