            <h1>Week 8 <small>(September 23, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>um... 21</h3>
            <p><small>Hola Familia,<br>
    Well this week was really busy, just not busy with lots of work.
Tuesday was just a normal day. Nothing too cool to speak of. Just
trying to find people to teach and stuff, but because we are in
Bolivia, people are really flaky. Actually, 2 cool things. 1, we got a
cell phone. It is like the best thing ever cause now we can actually
confirm appointments. It has already helped so much. 2, I got my first
letter letter from the states. It is only the ward newsletter from Wes
Smith, but it is still something. It was sent the 26th of august, so
it takes about 3 weeks. Wednesday was lame. We were just walking down
the street, minding our own business, when we hear ¨Jovenes!¨ from
behind us. We look back and see the police coming towards us. 2 guys
in green and a guy in a shirt and tie. Back story, about 2 weeks ago,
when we were dropping off people at the airport, some elders got
stopped and were asked for their passports. They got a citation
because all our stuff is in Cocha. Well the same guy recognized the
missionaries, knew I wouldnt have my stuff, and pulled us off to the
side and I got a citation. It was super lame. I had to have copies of
all my papers sent here and then we had to go to the imigrations
office to figure it out. I should be fine, but there is a chance I
might have to go to Cocha in the coming weeks to become legal. We will
see, but neither me nor Lopez are happy about it. Thursday we had a
conference with all the missionaries outside of Cocha. It was cool to
see Elder Christensen there, and also Elder Vasquez who I met from the
CCM. Elder Calderon was great. He talked a lot about using the
members, how to be a successful missionary, and how to speak with
power when we challenge people. There was a video by Elder Holland,
and the spirit was so strong with that video. He said that everytime
we are rejected and yelled at, we are standing at the side of the
Savior. Friday I got to go on an intercambio with Elder Cedano from
Peru. He is cool to work with. When he speaks it has such sincerety
and he really means what he says. It was cool. His area is really
tough physically, but the people were nice. At the end of the night I
was ready to be back in my area, cause it feels like home. From what
he told me, I have the best spanish of my group and the group one
transfer ahead, so that made me feel good. We also had the baptismal
interview for Hector on Friday, he passed, so we decided to start
filling the font for saturday morning. But... in september october and
those months, the shut off the water sometimes in Sucre. Happens every
year. So friday night, there wasnt water. We had to go to the chapel
at 6 am saturday morning to fill the font. The heater was broken too,
so we got 5 water heaters that hold 2 liters, and used those to try to
heat the font. We probably filled like 500 liters or more by hand. The
water was dirty and freezing, but Hector was baptized saturday
morning. It was a great experience. He talked about how he has been
changed by the gospel and he felt like a new person. 1 down, many to
go. Other than that, the work was slow this week. People just arent
home, or dont listen. Me and Elder Lopez have a great plan for this
week though, and we are expecting to have success. Other than that,
life is pretty good. I havent gotten sick, only Lopez has been bitten
by a dog, and it was a nip. The church is still true here in Bolivia.
Oh, we had lunch with the Bishops family yesterday. It was cool cause
he served in Utah, so he asks me a lot of questions and it makes me
feel at home. This week there isnt any holidays (which there are way
too many here in Bolivia) and hopefully we can find success. I love
you all and please write as much as you can, cause the letters are
always really comforting. I guess this is it. I am done with 3 months,
21 left. 1/8 of the way done, kinda weird. Love you all. Os amo<br>
   Love, El ùnico Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <p>70/100<br><br>Well back to work... Today we had our first District and Zone meetings of the transfer. It helped me realize that I have come really far. The first reunion (meeting in Spanish, not sure why I put the Spanish word) I fell asleep. This one I was talking and commenting like the real elder Bagley. We went back to Rumi Rumi for the first time in about a week. We didn't find anything... We came back to teach Hector. We taught him about the law of tithing and such things. He is on the strait and narrow to get baptized. Later we went to teach Hna. Wilma. She is having problems coming to church cause she is busy and it is far away. We literally talked for 2 hours. Me and Lopez just threw down a bunch of things that should help her, but ultimately it is Dios (God) that will help her. The talking made me realize how lucky I am for what I have. Anyways, decent day. The best part of the day wa... we got a cell phone!!! It should make our lives so much easier and help the work.</p>

                        <p>70/100<br><br>Today was interesting to say the least. We started out with a service project rearranging furniture for Hno. David. After that, and finally laying down the law to Elder Loepz that we have to study more, we went to Rumi Rumi. We talked with Ambar. It was cool cause she says she reads her BoM every night. Problem is she lives so far away and hasn't come to church. We went knocking doors after that. I never trust my ability to trust the spirit, and then I always go to the right door where we get return appts. It is definitely the spirit everytime. While we were teaching a guy came by, told the lady we were liars from the USA that only want a civil war. We all laughed about it. After that we had a run in with the police. Cause I didn't have my passport, I have to go resolve the problem on Friday. I'm not really happy about it. Made me realize I would be devastated to leave this mission. After we taught Nancy and Roberto about the Plan of Salv and then got Hector ready for his baptism interview. Conference tomorrow, imigration Friday, baptism Saturday. Happy P-week.</p>

                        <p>75/100<br><br>Conferece day. Today we had a special missionary conference with all the elders from Sucre, Potosi, and Tupiza. It was cool to see Elder Christensen and Elder Vasquez again. We got to hear from Elder Calderon, of the Area 70 of South Amrtica. It was great. He talked a lot about the power we have as missioanries and how to have success. The two things that impacted me the most were: first, one elder said we can know how many seeds are in an apple, but not how many apples are in a seed, meaning we can't always know exactly the fruits of our labors, but they can be great. Second was when we watched a couple of conference talks. It hit me <u>hard</u> when Elder Holland said that when we are denied, yelled at, spit upon, we are standing at the Savior's side. Everything we do here is for the Lord. Today started the intercambio, so I am with Elder Cedano in his area tonight and tomorrow. I've already learned a lot from him. Good day today, felt a good spirit, life is good.</p>

                          <p>75/100<br><br>Today was the most different day that I have had so far in Sucre, because we had intercambios. I was with Elder Cedano all day. It was cool to be doing something different, but I really missed my area. I tried to go to imigrations today to resolve my issues, but of course they closed 5 minutes before we got there. I did get to talk with E' Herndon though, and that was cool. After that, me and Cedano did work in his area. It is so tough physically, up and down like crazy. We found like 3 new investigators, which was good. The thing I like about teaching with Cedano is that he has a certain power and sincerity in his words. He's only been a member for 5 years, so he has a conversion story. At night we went to Hector's baptismal interview. Of course he passed. Problem is, the cut off the water until 10 tonight, so we have to go back tomorrow in the morning at like 6 to fill the font. Worth it though. I better go to bed though, long day tomorrow.<br> <u>Side note:</u> we were teaching the Fam. Espejo and the daughter, probably in her 20s, needed to feed her baby... during the lesson. So she just popped "it" out and fed him, for everyone to see. Bolivia is different.</p>

                          <p>75/100<br><br><b>Baptism #1</b> Hector Suarez<br>So I had my first baptism today. E' Lopez baptized him. As stated in the other page, we had to wake up at 5:45, and we were at the chapel at 6. The water was super slow, and super cold. To try and speed and warm things up, we probably filled 30%-50% by hand, with heated water pitchers. Probably around like 700 Lt of water by hand. We got home at 9:30. All worth it for the baptism. Freezing water that was super dirty, but the baptism happened. Great spirit and he'll be a great member. We ate lunch with their family too. They are happy to have a full family of members now. Other than that, we talked with Wilma and her husband, and they seem better. Also, we talked with the Fam. Plaza and Gabriel and Joel are just awesome. Finally we went to the ward karaoke thing, and me, Lopez, Cedano, and Long sang We are the Champions and then me and Lopez sang Hotel California. Espina came back sick, back he is doing better. That is all for today. BAPTISM!</p>

Hector was confirmed. I got to participate. We ate lunch with the bishop and the family of Hna. Sandra. We had a really good weekly planning session, and I think we are gonna have some success this week. P-day tomorrow, and it is much needed.<br><br>75/100<br><br>23: P-day, woo! Pretty sure I put that every p-day. I don't know why, but I just wasn't feeling the internet today. My family's letters are getting shorter and they are the same every time. Guess they are used to me being a missionary now. Anyways, I spent a lot of the day with Elder Herndon, the ZL. I am starting to be pretty good friends with him. He also helps me with the stupid migrations. We played a lot of ping pong today. I'm still not great, but I am getting better. We played with some tiny paddles too. At night we had FHE with the Camacho family. They are a younger couple with 2 little girls. They are super cool. It is the best when the families actually plan FHE. Anyways, good p-day. Ready to destroy this week with some high numbers. It's gonna be good...</p>
