            <h1>Week 7 <small>(September 16, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>Me ha dicho</h3>
            <p><small>Dearest Family of Mine<br>
  How are you all? This week had a lot of things happen, so it feels
like I havent written in forever. Anyways, this week was flat out
crazy. As I said, Sunday night had cambios, my first. We thought after
sunday it was all over, but nope. Monday we got a call that Elder
Muñoz, who was in my ward, was staying in Sucre, but going to a
different area. He was so sad to go. I liked him, so it sucked. His
replacement is Elder Long, who was in another part of Sucre, but is
now here. They almost never keep missionaries in Sucre but send them
to a different area. This cambio was hecho tiras. On top of all this,
we had trio for 4 days this week. First tuesday with Elder Mickle,
then wednesday and thursday with Elder Cedano, and finally friday with
Elder Cusiatao. Saturday was good to just have a break with just me
and Lopez. On top of all that too, this week was the entrada, a
festival for the Virgen of Guadalupe. People just dancing in festivals
friday and saturday. For that, there was literally no one in our area
friday or saturday. We had 2 lessons in 2 days, and we usually shoot
for about 10. The week was just crazy. Anyways, somehow we found some
success. Hector is getting baptized on Saturday! (insert happy dance).
He is beyond ready and is just great. Now the whole family will be
members. He came to church, and we also had 6 other investigators, so
7, my new record. Other than Hector, our best investigators are
probably Nancy and Roberto, and older couple. She stopped us on the
street one day and asked if we were mormons, cause she had lived in La
paz and had talked with some hermanas before. She let us in and it was
great. She is really catholic, but likes our beliefs. She tells us Que
lindo que bello about all the things we say. Also, her husband Roberto
is awesome. He has the voice of like a book on tape or something. He
also just believes everything. When we gave him the BoM, he had us
write our names, the date, and a message inside so he could show
everyone where he got the book. They both came to church on Sunday and
just talked about how much they loved it and the spirit they could
feel. Also we have Dennis, Hector`s friend. He is like 14 years old,
6´1, 200lbs, and just a giant. He is a little quiet, but he is always
so thankful when we come. He came to church too. We are gonna place a
baptismal date the next time. The thing in this mission is baptismal
dates arent firm dates. They are more of goals. We have never had less
than 6 dates, but they always fall through cause people dont come to
church. Hector will be baptized on the 21st, cause we are going over
tonight to plan the program. This week we are gonna have a conference
again, with Elder Calderon, an area seventy. We fasted on Saturday to
prepare ourselves. Naturally, nancy offered us pineapple, cookies,
juice, cinnamon things... so we took them home and ate them yesterday.
I feel like I am kinda rambling, but oh well. Other things that have
happened this week. We got a new gringo in our apartment. Elder Harris
from Washington. He is new, and I feel cool cause I can show him the
ropes. It makes me realize that I have come so far in 6 weeks. It also
makes my spanish feel good. Also, me and Elder Long are gonna teach an
English class for the ward. We are trying to think of new ways to find
investigators, and hopefully that works. Today was the best start of a
p day ever. Instead of going to the gym like usually, we had an
intercambio, so I am with Elder Espina from Chile right now. He lives
in our apartment. Elder Harris is a gym guy and went with Lopez. Cause
of this, I slept in till 7 30, cleaned my room, relaxed. It was great.
Oh, the title comes from this old lady in our ward. She talks like no
other. We went to teach her son one day, less active, and she talked
for 80% of the lesson. Her name is Yolanda. She is super nice, but
cant shut up. We literally walked for 5 minutes with her yesterday,
and she said Me Ha Dicho, at least 20 times. It translates to
something like, he had told me, or she told me. Problem is, she like
starts and ends every sentence with it. I started laughing cause she
said it so many times. It isnt intentional either, so it is just
funny. Well, this is all for this week. Life is getting better, I have
almost finished 3 months, which is weird. My favorite scripture from
this week is just Alma 32, all about faith. It is great. Anyways,
hasta lunes!<br>
Con Amor,<br>

                      <p>70/100<br><br>Not sure why I'm so tired today. Probably cause I went to every side of Sucre today. We went to the airport to drop off Elder Espina cause he is in Cochabamba for training. Cause of that we had Elder Mickle with us today. It's not that we don't get along, it's just that we are like best friends. It was still cool to have him with us to see how others teach. With him, we taught Hector and then a new investigator named Maria. After that we ended up nearly at the top of Cerro Churuquella, just about as far away from the airport as possible. After that we went to the house of Hmo. Arce and his wife. We had FHE with them. They are great members. Steady in the church and they want to help us. Members really are so important to help us. Their house was really far away though, so that was the other side. Overall, I'm done with my first cambio. When I look back, it went kinda fast, but when I look forward, I feel like there is an eternity left. Oh well, 2 down, 15 to go.</p>

                        <p>72/100<br><br>Woo, day 1 of cambio 2. Really to look back and think that I've been here for 6 weeks, 1 1/2 months is a little weird. STill a lot left though. Today was weird a little. We went to the airport to drop off Mickle. We ended up leaving with Cedano because his comp didn't show up yet. Apparently he isn't the most obedient missionary, so that'll be fun... anyways, we didn't have a super successful day. We actually had study, and Alma 32 is a great chapter about faith. We taught Miguel and Gorki Leon about the importance of the scriptures. Gorki offered to come with us a later day to an appointment. We get more help from Hector and Gorki, non-members, than the members. I felt pretty good about what I did, cause I felt like I was leading the group. I'm a little scared that the new missionary might influence Lopez for the worse. Just as I'm starting to focus more on the work, I don't want a macanero (bad missioanry) for a companion. Oh well, just gotta pray and realize everything happens for a reason. God's got His plan.</p>

                        <p>75/100<br><br>Today just kind of happened. I didn't really realize that it happened, it just kind went without me. I finally met the new missionary that replaced Elder Mickle. It is Elder Harris from Washington. He's pretty cool I guess. Kinda emotionless, and the spanish is like mine was, but still cool. Also, we learned that Elder Long, who is in another ward in Sucre, is gonna be Elder Cedano's companion. This cambio was really weird. It didn't end till today, and it usually ends Sunday. Anyways, we had Cedano again. He's kinda lazy. He just walks around with us, but doesn't wanna teach. We taught Dennys today, with the help of Hector. We also taught Juana in the morning, and she told us she wanted to be baptized before we asked. We went to teach a lady that stopped us in the street, and we ended up being there for 2 hours. She likes to talk, but when her husband showed up we started teaching, and he (the husband) told us we were like angels. Cedano actually helped a lot in that lesson. Finally we taught Hector the law of chastity. Overall, decent day. A thought came to me today that is like a life theme. Whether you are good or bad, it's not what you did, it's what you're doing. no es lo que has hecho, es lo que estás haciendo</p>

                          <p>60/100<br><br>Very unsuccessful day. Today we had a service in the morning, so that was successful I guess. After that we did our weekly planning. To continue the streak, we had Elder Cusiatao with us. Tuesday with Mickle, Wednesday and Thursday with Cedano, and Friday with Cusi. I'm just excited for a day when we can just do our own thing. It was good to have the ZL here so I could ask him some questions and advice and stuff. #1, we don't study enough, especially for me being new. Anyways, today was the start of the flipping "entrada". It is some dance thing for the virgen Guadalupe or something. It was a big deal. Because of this, we couldn't find anyone, cause they were all watching the festival. On top of this, it started raining hard and it was cold. Overall, definitely not one of the best days in the mission. It was friday the 13th after all. Oh well, we have appointments tomorrow, so hopefully we can get some success.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                          <p>80/100<br><br>Today started out like crap. Cusi woke us up at 5:30 because we had to go to the bus terminal to get his comp E' Herndon. After a cranky morning, we planned the week, had lunch, and started our fast. We are fasting to prepare ourselves for Elder CAlderon, a 70, next week. Fasting was hard today. Since the "entrada" is still going on, it is like the outer edges of the city is dead. We couldn't find anyone. We talked with Hna. Sandra for a bit, Maria knocked over a glass of juice. Of course she offers us a smoothie when we are fasting. We went to teach Hna. Nancy, Hno. Roberto, and their son Jorge. They are great. Super accepting, believe everything we say, and are just great. They are super catholic though. We just have to direct their faith in the right direction. It was cool cause we gave them a Book of Mormon and Roberto had us write our names and a little message in it. I feel like we can baptize the family. They gave us delicious looking treats, but of course we are fasting. Finally, we went over to the Leon house and help nail nails for Micaela and Priyanka's art projects. It was good just to chill with their family. Overall, pretty quick day.</p>

                          <p>81/100<br><br>Woohoo, success! We had some success at church. 7 investigators at church today. Miguel and Micaela Leon, Hector, Dennis, Nancy, Roberto, and Estella. Hector is getting baptized on Saturday. The rest liked church. It was great. After church (learned Rodrigo is leaving for 3 months) we ate lunch with some members. The little kid, Josue, probably 2yrs old was super funny; food everywhere, walking around without pants... After that, we went to a plaza to teach Cintia, the friend of Madeline. She is cool, listens, but doesn't want to change her religion. I also talked to a German guy in english for a bit. Finally we had a lesson with Dennis. He seems like he is gonna progress. He is really receptive. Hector helped is too. We chatted with both after the lesson, which I think is good. Overall, I feel pretty good. Somehow, Sunday's always have the most walking, but when we have 7 investigators come to church it is worth is. I am so ready for p-day though. Church is still true after 13 weeks in the mission, and it will always be God's church</p>

                          <p>80/100<br><br>P-day, the best day of the week. Not that I don't like spreading the gospel and changing lives, it's just that I like having free time. Anyways, probably the best p-day yet. Instead of going to the gym like usual, E' Harris went with Elder Lopez to the gym, and I stayed home with Elder Espina. I accomplished so much more, it was great. Cleaned my desk, arranged things, sorted my ties by color. Just a lot more relaxed. Went to the internet, where now I received letters from everyone, family, friends (Joey Kaelin, Andrew Poulter, Jamison Wagner, Steven Braun, Brandon Carter, Jeremy Endicott, etc.) awesome to hear from them all. I also played wallyball for the first time. I did well, so I felt good. We also played soccer and ping pong. Playing sports helps me gain respect from other elders, cause I am decent enough. Finally at night we visited Hna. Yolanda for a bit. I watned to kill myself. She just can't stop talking. She literally talked for 25 minutes non stop. I was cringing cause we try to say stuff, but she cuts us off. Uh... well, off to bed. I am actually excited for this week.</p>
