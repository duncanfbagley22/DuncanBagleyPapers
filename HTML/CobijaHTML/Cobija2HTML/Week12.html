            <h1>Week 12 <small>(August 11, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3><Title>Anchors Away</Title></h3>
        <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
            Well, I assume that the rest of you are pretty preocupied with the
        same thing that´s been on my mind the last week...the Bolivian
        elections. No, just kidding, I have been thinking about Griffin
        leaving a lot this week. Not that I haven´t paid attention here, but I
        definitely was thinking about it. It is just so weird to me, but super
        awesome at the same time. I remember that time a year ago and it is
        crazy that Griffin´s time has already come. I am so excited for the
        first email though. I know my letter might not be the number one
        focus, but when he´s gone and everyone is sad, maybe my letter can
        distract them. Anyways, I had an interesting week, especially with
        yesterday, but I will go day by day and explain what happened.<br>
        Monday- Paint fight woo! Took forever to wash off though.<br>
        Tuesday- Not really expected, but last minute the temple schedule
        changed and we went on Tuesday morning. It was super good. Our zone
        was able to enter into one session all together. It was super cool.
        Our zone is really united and it was cool that we could all be in the
        session. Afterwards we went and took pictures and then we went to the
        stake center and had a testimony meeting with our zone. After that I
        just went to the office and I had my meetings with the zone leaders. I
        usually just sit in my desk for hours at a time. I am always just
        ready to die at the end of Tuesday.<br>
        Wednesday- Nothing too exciting, but I just hung out with a guy named
        Elder Porter all day. He was here for tramites. He is from St George.
        We randomly found out that he is like best friends with Jamison´s
        cousin and he met Jamison and Parker before the mission. He is from
        Griffin´s graduating class, which is a little bit weird for me. Also,
        wednesday was Bolivian independence day. It was basically an excuse to
        close everything in the city and do nothing. We couldnt find anything
        open and it actually made our job a little bit more difficult.<br>
        Thursday- We had a pretty boring day. A lot of times, we just have
        people staying with us for tramites stuff. We had 3 people with us
        this week. Elder Porter and 2 other guys. It is kind of annoying to
        have people with us because they are loud at night and then they
        always need a companion that makes us have to mess up our schedule. I
        really didnt have much to do on Thursday either, so it was just an
        overall boring day. At night we had our Noche de Hermanamiento, but it
        was actually a surprise party for our bishop. It was his birthday, so
        we had a dinner for him and stuff. It makes me realize that our bishop
        is great, because he has the support of the whole ward. There are a
        lot of lame bishops here, but he is how a bishop should be.<br>
        Friday- Another kind of boring day. We played soccer in the morning
        and that was fun. Then we finally shipped off the tramites guys so it
        was back to just us four. Friday morning we went to the mission home
        because Elder Prado had to help Hermana Hansen give an english test,
        so I just waited downstairs and talked to some of the missionaries
        that were there for their final interviews. It is weird because I
        remember when this group of missionaries hit a year in the mission,
        and now they are all going home. A few of them have been my zone
        leaders and stuff like that, so I am kind of sad to see them go.
        Before I know it I will be in the same place. We also had a lesson at
        night. She is a new investigator named Adriana. She is just generally
        interested in exploring new churches because she has been a catholic
        for her whole life. She is someone that could really progress.<br>
        Saturday- The longest of all the days this week. We started off doing
        splits, where I went with Elder Christensen to help him and Prado went
        with Elder Calderon. I had almost nothing to do in the office. I
        licked a lot of envelopes which was long, boring, and tasted terrible.
        After the morning we went to help the leaving missionaries take some
        pictures. It was funny because I was talking to some random
        missionaries and they kept telling me all the rumors that they had
        heard about the cambios and who they thought was going where. The
        mission is like high school in some aspects, because rumors can spread
        through the mission in a matter of hours. If someone gets sent home,
        somehow the mission all knows by the next day. After lunch, we went
        back to the office. I was so bored that I fell asleep. After waiting
        for a while, Elder Prado finally came back and we rushed to an
        appointment. We went back to teach the reference from the area 70. He
        is a catholic deacon, but he is interested in learning about our
        beliefs and the Book of Mormon especially. It´ll be a long process to
        get him converted, but we are the true church, so it makes it
        possible.<br>
        Sunday- Pretty normal. We had church and everything was fine. No one
        we invited to church came though. We had dinner with that lady that
        served in Quito, and that started to make me think more of Griff, just
        talking about Ecuador and knowing that he was giving his farewell at
        that time. In the afternoon, we went around looking for things to do.
        We couldnt really find much, and we even started following a dog for a
        minute hoping he would tell us where to go. Finally we stopped at
        Wilson´s house and talked to him. He is progressing well, but he was
        sick so he didnt go to church. We had a good lesson and we were able
        to give him a blessing. He just needs to use the atonement and
        everything will be ok. Sunday was also cambios. We had all seen the
        cambios, so we didnt think anything was happening. We are all staying,
        but there was one change. We didnt know it was going to happen, but it
        isnt a huge surprise. I am going to be with Elder Christensen now, as
        companions, for the 2nd time. I am going to miss Prado, we were
        starting to work well together and he was improving. For now I am
        going to go to barrio Ingavi, but I am trying to talk to the APs so
        that we are in Cobija still, just cause it makes more sense. We will
        have to wait and see though. We dont really want to bug President
        Hansen right now. I am excited to work with Elder Christensen again.
        We should do well wherever they put us.<br>
        Monday- In the morning we went to go get Prado´s hair cut, and then we
        had to go pick up another tramites guy at the airport. We went,
        dropped him off, and then we left for lunch. Me, Prado, Elder Mickle
        (lived with him in Sucre), and Elder Amaya (his uncle just ended being
        mission president in... Guayaquil Norte, small world). We ate chinese
        food at a restaurant called "Chinese Food". It was really cheap and
        surprisingly good. Better than the regular rice and potatoes. Then we
        went to the office, but I had to do work so I couldnt write you guys.
        We played soccer for a few hours after that, and that was fun too.
        Overall, a good p day.<br><br>
        
        Well, there is my boring week. I am sure all of us are more focused on
        Griff right now. I feel like I am going to miss him, even though I
        havent seen him in 14 months. This week will just be us helping out
        the new missionaries, so it´ll be full of long days. I love you guys
        so much, and I am super excited to read Griffin´s first email next
        week. I titled this Anchors Away because Griffin is setting sail for
        Ecuador (sorry, I wasnt really creative today). Love you guys, and
        talk to you next week.<br>

                        <p>Well, today started off perfectly. We went to the temple! Woooooooo! It was great. I love the temple. It's just so peaceful to be inside and I forget about everything else. My favorite part is always the celestial room, because it is silent and peaceful and you can really think. After that, we went outside to take the big group picture. After all the temple festivities, we went to our zone meeting. We had a giant testimony meeting. It was really cool and you could really feel the spirit. I learned a lot about some people, things I didn't know before. It was one of the better zone meetings I've been to, and I continue to realize that our zone is the best. After the meeting and lunch, I had my meetings with the zone leaders and just cranked through as much work as I could. The chair started forming to my body I think. Even though the ZL meetings were the temple and the zone testimony meeting were about as good as I could hope for.</p>

                        <p>Today wasn't quite as good as yesterday. Actually, it was boring. Today was Bolivian Independence day. Nothing was open at all. I assume in certain parts of the city there were parties and stuff, but over by us everything was dead. Basically I just hung out with Elder Porter all day. He is Elder Weekes cousin and he knows my roomate, Jamison Wagner's cousin in St. George. We get along pretty well. He just looks at my job and tells me how boring it is. Which is true, it is pretty boring. It takes a special kind of person to stae at a computer screen full of numbers all day. At night me, Porter, and Elder Christensen played HORSE on my nerf hoop in the office. It was really fun, but I lost. Overall, it was a boring day. Bolivian Independence day isn't all it is cracked up to be.</p>

                        <p>Today wasn't very entertaining either. There are really just 2 points that I'd like to focus on. First is that I'm tired of tramites guys. We've got 3 guys here. I actually like Elder Porter. We get along super good and he's easy going. The 2nd guy is Elder Alvarez. He's kinda weird and immature, Not annoying, but he makes life difficult sometimes. The annoying one is Elder Lugo. He says he's from Puerto Rico (even though his spanish is decent at best). He is one of those kids that thinks he is the strongest, funniest, and smartest person in the world. He loves talking about himself. He just a generic annoying kid. We'll have them till Friday... The other thing is that we had our Noche de Hermanamiento/birthday dinner for the bishop. There were actually a lot of people there, which shows how awesome our bishop is because everyone loves him. It was fun too because Benjamin showed up. Anyways, a good enough day, but I'm ready to have the tramites guys leave.</p>

                        <p>Today was kinda fun. In the morning I went with Prado to the mission home to help Hna Hansen with Elder Merejildo's english test. I just talked with Elder Adams and Elder Singer most of the time while I waited. After that we went to the office where I spent a lot of time talking with Elder Garrido and Elder De Horta. Even though De Horta is a little bit crazy, I had a good time talking to them. They are both old missionaries, so it is fun to talk about the good ole days. The rest of the time I spent in the office was pretty boring. At night we had an appt with this new investigator named Adriana. She is actually kinda interested. we just asked questions in order to get to know her and I really think she is interested and could progress. I enjoy teaching, and it is a lot more gratifying than office work. I need to get out and teach more.<br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>Today was really boring, but it turned out well. I had to go with Elder Christensen in the morning to the office. I did a few things, like lick 17 envelopes. Envelopes taste terrible. After the office we went to go help the leaving missionaries take pictures. I'm gonna miss a lot of those guys, like E Robertson, E Jarrell, and E Singer. It's a good group. We then had to go to lunch (me and Christensen) because Calderon was taking a long time doing something and we would've been really late if we would've waited for Prado. The afternoon was terrible. We had to go back to the office, but I had nothing to do. I ended up falling aslepp. Finally we met up with the other 2, and me and Prado rushed to our appt. It was with Carlos Angel Jordan, a ref from an Area 70. He is a catholic deacon, but he is cool. He isn't interested in baptism just yet, but he likes learning so that's a start. 2 days in a row with a lesson, so things are lookin good.</p>

                        <p>Well, that puts a wrench in everything. I'll explain at the end. Today was ok I guess. We had church and everything like normal. I was kinda dissappointed because we didn't have anyone we invited come. I was also really tired. After church we had lunch with Flia Quiroz. They are a cool family. The mom is the one that served in Quito, so talking about that made me just think of Griffin and him giving his farewell talk. I was really hungry, and I finished way before everyone else. After that we went looking for things to do. We couldn't really find anything, but we did have a good lesson with Wilson Arispe. He couldn't go to church because he was sick. He is still doing well though. After that, and having a generally good time with Prado, we had cambios night. Surprise to everyone, they switched the companionships in the office, so I'm with Christensen now in Ingavi. I'm actually more sad than glad, as I was getting along with Prado, and I like Cobija. I want it changed (the areas) cause it'd make more sense, but whatever the Lord wants is fine with me.</p>

                        <p>The day after cambios. It was pretty good. I cleaned the house in the morning, and then I went with Prado so he could get his haircut. After that we went to the airport to pick up Elder Lugo. From there we went to the stake center to drop him off. We sat around for a while waiting to see if we were going to get food there, but we didn't. We eventually went with Elder Mickle and Elder Amaya to a chinese food place. It was surprisingly good. We did have some random guy ask us for money, but other than that it was good. We went to go do internet, but I had to work, so I didn't write much. Then we played futsal. I really like playing, and I like the moment where everyone realizes I play well and they're shocked. We got back to the office, but I had an uncomfortable situation. I was trying to write my family, especially Griffin, because he leaves on Wednesday. Weekes and Saad were bugging me and for 15ish minutes I asked them to leave nicely, but they wouldn't. I kinda flipped out at them and it was uncomfortable. I didn't know what else to do. I said sorry, so it's all good. Tomorrow starts at 3 for me, so it should be fun...</p>
