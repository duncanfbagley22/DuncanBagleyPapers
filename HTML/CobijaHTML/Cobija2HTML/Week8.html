            <h1>Week 8 <small>(July 14, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3><Title>Dont Give Up</Title></h3>
        <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
            First off, HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hope it was great.
         Usually I try to put a title that reflects what happened in the week,
         but this one is basically just what happened today. I will explain
         today, then I will talk about what happened earlier in the week. Today
         we went to a place called Pairumani. It is this little camping park
         kinda thingy. It was cool because to get there, we drove through El
         Paso, so I got to show everybody my old stomping ground. It was pretty
         fun. My zone is so cool. Definitely the best zone I have been in. It
         is cool because the zone leaders are cool (sometimes Zone Leaders are
         party poopers or too lazy to plan activities, but ours are cool). The
         hermanas are cool (like they enjoy activities and dont want to just go
         shopping every p day like most hermanas). Everyone is pretty obedient
         too, which is rare. I get along with everyone and it is great. We
         hiked up to a waterfall and ate lunch there. We played around and took
         a bunch of pictures and stuff. Me and Elder Alexander (my old ZL in
         Alamos) hiked up to this little look out type place that we
         discovered. It was a kinda sketchy climb and at one point he took a
         step and accidently sent a big rock tumbling down at me, but I dodged
         it, so I was ok. It was a little adventure. After that we met up with
         the rest of the zone and took pictures by the waterfall. That are some
         good looking pictures. Then we just hiked back down and went home. On
         the bus ride home, we plugged in someone´s USB and listened to church
         appropriate music. At one point we heard this song called "Dont Give
         Up" by Josh Groban. We were singing it super loud in the bus and we
         passed through this plaza in Quillacollo and sang it out the window to
         people. It seemed to make everyone outside happy and we were having a
         blast. Quite the fun trip. So that is why the title is what it is. So
         that was today, here is what happened the rest of the week.
         <br><br>
         World Cup- I am proud to say I didnt watch a single second of the semi
         finals or the finals of the world cup. We heard the Brazil and Germany
         score and it sounded terrible, 7-1. There are a lot of Brazilians in
         Cocha, so they were all sad. Yesterday was rough, because literally no
         one was outside and we couldnt find anything to do. We tried, but it
         didnt work very well. I really like the world cup, but as a
         missionary, I am glad it is over. People are addicted here.
         <br><br>
         Benjamin- So this week we had Elder Coffing stay with us. He had to do
         tramites. He is from Utah and has like 3 months less than me. He came
         with us to our Noche de Hermanamiento thing on Thursday. There is this
         little 8 year old kid that isnt a member and isnt even an investigator
         but he always just randomly shows up to the ward activities on
         Thursdays. He is a little chubby guy and super funny, so me and Elder
         Coffing fell in love with him. He is just a little round ball of joy
         and speaks like a prototypical Bolivian (hard to explain how that is,
         but I will show you when I get home). He made Thursday night fun.
         <br><br>
         Miracle Number 1- So even though I am in the office, cool things still
         happen. So lately we have had a small problem with own of the owners
         of a house in Cochabamba. Long story short, we had no record of 10
         months of rent, or 9500bs ($1400). So we were trying to find out what
         happened to the money. They found out that the sister of the owner had
         like 8 months worth, but was missing October and November. The sister
         is a shady character, so we can never really trust her. Elder Gallegos
         told me they paid every month, so the receipts existed, but we didnt
         know where because neither of us was there in that time. So, Saturday
         I decided to search everything to find out if we had a random receipt.
         After like 30 minutes of looking, I found the receipt in an envelope
         in a box in a shelf in the other part of the office. Basically found
         the equivilant of a needle in a haystack. I was really happy after
         finding it. I didnt find the other one, but we still saved 950bs
         ($140), which is a good chuck of money. I was glad that the Lord
         guided me to find it.
         <br><br>
         Miracle Number 2- We had 2 miracles this week, but this one is even
         cooler. So last Sunday President Hansen called and said that I needed
         to give money to someone because they spent all their money on
         something they shouldnt have bought, felt bad and gave it to President
         Hansen, and Pres wanted me to give him money for a second chance.
         Well, that second chance didnt work and this missionary decided to go
         home (I got the money I gave him back though, so dont worry). Anyways,
         because of this, me and E Christensen woke up at 5 30 and had to go to
         the airport. We got everything taken care of, he got through security,
         and we went home happy to be done. However... we got a call from
         President Hansen saying the missionary called him and he had a stupid
         tax he had to pay and he didnt have money. Usually we give money to
         people to go home in case of emergency, but because it was a direct
         flight, there was no need to. We ran back to the airport only to find
         out that everything was ok. We got to security and this member was
         sitting there. He came up and explained that he was the patriarch of
         one of the stakes here and was there dropping his son and wife off.
         His son saw the missionary freaking out and looking like he was going
         to miss his flight, and the son just paid the fee from his own pocket.
         Me and E Christensen were at a loss of words. The patriarch´s son was
         just in a perfect spot and apparently when he was on his mission
         something similar happened, so he was the perfect person. The Lord is
         always with us. Even though it isnt regular missionary work, He is
         there for us when we need Him. It was incredible.
         <br><br>
         Flia Elias- There is this family of a less active mom and her non
         member kids that has decided to come back to church. All four of us
         missionaries really gets along with them and they come to church all
         the time now. They were technically the Hnas investigators, but the
         teenage kid, Sebastian, gets along really well with Prado, so we have
         an FHE tonight with them. I feel like the 3 kids will be baptized
         soon, not sure whose converts they will be, but it doesnt matter. I
         just want them to be baptized.
         <br><br>
         So that is what happened this week. It was a somewhat long feeling
         week, but it was cool to be able to see the Lord´s hand helping us in
         our work. I love you guys so much and I will talk to you next week.
         <br><br>
         Love,<br>
           Elder Bagley</small></p>

                        <p>Well I got a blessing and I'm better. I'm not perfect, but I can walk on my ankle now. I should be good in a few days. Elder Christensen gave me a blessing and that priesthood thing works. It is weird because at this time last year Elder Christensen got hurt and I gave him a blessing. Irony... Anyways, today was a busy day. At 8:30 I had to go to the Post OFfice to send money to Sucre. The Tupiza ZLs went to Sucre unprepared. After sending them money, I went back and studied Mormon 7 and 8. It is cool because it feels like Mormon and Moroni are talking to me directly. After that we went to our zone meeting. It was good, they just went over stuff from the zone conference. We went to lunch, and then I had my zone leader meetings. Everyone showed up later, so I was rushing through so I could get caught up. I finally finished at 7. The ZLs really help me out though, so that is nice. We found out Brazil lost to Germany 7-1 in the world cup. Other than that stuff, we just went to dinner and then we went home. It was a quick day, but really busy.</p>

                        <p>Woohoo! Happy Birthday Prado!!! Today really didn't have many exciting moments. Basically, today we celebrated Prado's birthday. At lunch I made a secret combination to buy Prado a cake. I figured he deserved it. After lunch we went to the offices. After working for a little bit, we (me and Christensen) went to run errands. We had to go do things for E Suarez because he apparently is going home tomorrow. After doing that, I went back to the office where I helped Frutillar with some things. Elder Phillips and Elder Jacobson came. It was really fun talking to them. Phillips has become one of my best friends in the mission. AFter that, we stalled in the office for a bit before going to the pension and surprising Prado with a cake. I think it made him happy. Overall, a good enough day.</p>

                        <p>Today I got up a 5:30. We had to go to the airport to drop Suarez off to go home. I really have no idea why he's going home. Christensen is sneaky. So we did that and hurried back to the house. The other 2 didn't even know we left. All of the sudden Christensen told me we had to go back because Suarez had some tax thing he had to pay and might miss his flight. So we "flew" back to the airport. We got back to the airport, but to our surprise everything was ok. I guess the Patriarch here in Cocha was there to drop his wife off, and saw Suarez in trouble. He decided to help Suarez and pay the 120bs fine. That was a miracle for us. Just by "chance" the guy happened to be there at 6:30am. Cool experience. After that, we waited/slept in the airport till this tramites guy got back. Then office and lunch. At about 7 we left to the ward activity. E Coffing came with us. We didn't have many people this time. There was a little fat kid named Benjamin that me and Coffing fell in love with. After the mediocre activity, we went to the pension. We are starting to really be bothered by Calderon. He thinks he the most important and really like the fame. Sometimes I want to tell him off, but I never do. He still hates the APs for some stupid argument a week and a half ago. I'm just tired of him. However, the worse he gets, the more grateful I am for Prado. It was a long day, and I wanna sleep.</p>

                        <p>Today was pretty uneventful. I woke up at kept the morning schedule well, which was good. After that me and Calderon went to drop off Elder Coffing for his tramites. Then we went to the office. Everything there was good until the afternoon. I had to meet with Frutillar's owner to get a contract made. I got to hang out with Phillips, Jacobsen, and Grigor which is fun. Also I got mad at Calderon because he bought a 220bs cell phone without telling me. He went home after cause he was sick. At night I went with Prado, Christensen, and our Elders quorum president to visit this guy named Johnathon. He was cool, he met Pinta before he left on his mission. That really is all that happened today. Not a bad day, but not exciting.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>Happy Birthday Susan Bagley, the best mom in the world!!! Ya, so today was interesting enough. First I had to go with Calderon to the zone conference to drop off breakfast. I sneaked my way into getting free breakfast though, so it was good. After that I went to the office for a second, then back home. We accidently fell asleep for like an hour, which isn't good. After that we went to each lunch and then we had to go to the office. I had a job to do. Find one receipt out of the thousands I have. We needed to have proof of paying or we were going to have to pay the rent again for Frutillar. After searching for a while, I finally found it. It was like a needle in a haystack. I was sooooooooo happy. We saved 950bs with that receipt. It was a miracle to say the least. After that we went out and worked. We didn't really find anything. We met the most prideful person ever. He said he used to play pro soccer and then wouldn't stop talking about it. He said he played for Boca Juniors and had a bunch of money and stuff. He was really annoying. After that we just ate dinner and went home. It was a good day, but weird at the same time.</p>

                        <p>In one day from today, Griffin leaves. That's kinda weird. Today was boring. We went to church and it was normal. I'm convinced that Prado is 14. There's this investigator named Sebastian and he and Prado are like best friends now. Sebastian is 12, but they seem the same age. After church we ate at this member's house, but it was a restaurant, and the member didn't eat with us, so we basically ate at a restaurant. We tried working, but the city was dead because of the world cup finals. Everyone was inside. We were trying, but it was like there weren't any other people. At that moment (walking with nothing happening) I found out I had to go to the office in emergency. That took away almost the rest of the night. We had time to contact one old lady, but that was it. Ovreall, a quite uneventful day. I'm glad the world cup is over now.</p>

                        <p>Today was a great p-day. We got up and got to the chapel at 8:30 in order to get on the bus to go to Pairumani. We got in and headed west towards the mountains. It was cool because we passed through El Paso, so I got to see my old stomping ground. I was glad everyone could see what it is that I talk about all the time. We had an interesting route, that had many of those small Bolivian roads with steep drop offs on the side that the bus drivers here amazingly navigate. It took a while, but we eventually got there. We got there and we immediately started hiking to the waterfall. It's a little man made waterfall, but it was cool. We took a bunch of great pictures. Our zone is just super cool. At one point, I went off with Elder Alexander on an adventure. We climbed most of a mountain. At one point he accidently sent a giant rock tumbling down at me and narrowly missed hurting me seriously. It was a fun adventure, and somewhat scary at times. After the waterfall, we went back down to the bus to go home. The bus ride home was fun. We hit a part where we started listening to "Don't give up" by Josh Groban. We were are singing it and singing it to the people outside the bus. It was great. After that we did internet, then me and Prado headed to an FHE. We went with the Flia Elias, this less active mom and her kids to the bishop's house. They used to be the Hna's investigators, but Prado is like best friends with the 12yr old son, so they are magically ours now. The FHE was good enough. The bishop and his family are super cool. I really think these kids will be baptized soon. It was a good day, and I'm ready for the new week.</p>
