            <h1>Week 10 <small>(July 28, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3><Title>Put Your Shoulder to the Wheel</Title></h3>
        <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
            What a week. Actually, it was kinda boring, and stressful, and
        long, and had some good parts. I dont really want to do a day by day
        summary or a summary of the big events, so I am just going to write
        and hope that everything comes to mind.<br>
                  Well, we started off the week still having no water. It is
        terrible to not have running water. We couldnt wash clothes or dishes,
        and we would either have to take showers in other places or just go
        without it. We finally were able to use the water on Thursday. I have
        never been more grateful for running water in my life. I never
        realized that it is a luxury, but it is basically one of the things I
        am most grateful for now. Wednesday we had an office staff meeting. It
        was more or less to help the Hansens understand what we do in the
        office. It was kind of dissappointing because the other 3 secretaries
        explained all the little things that they do, and mine was basically
        like this: Pres Hansen said "Elder Bagley, I think we already know
        what you do" and I said "yup, I work with the money..." and that was
        the extent of my presentation in the office meeting. My job isnt
        really that complicated, but it is just hard, or harder than the other
        ones. I am glad that President Hansen understands though. He seems to
        really like me, which is good. Hermana Hansen is awesome too. She is
        super funny and likes bothering me about how I have to sit in the
        office all day by myself. I am really glad they are the people
        assigned to this mission. Just found out today that President Dyer was
        mission companions with Elder Zwick of the seventy. Elder Zwick is a
        family friend of one of the assistants, and that same assistant´s
        grandpa was a member of the 70. Elder Zwick and Elder F Melvin Hammond
        spoke at this missionary, Elder Weekes´, farewell. Imagine that as a
        farewell meeting. I felt pressure and it was just me and Brandon Urry.
        Anyways, on Thursday I had an interview with President Hansen. It was
        a really short interview, I think it is cause he already knows me
        basically. He asked about my time on the mission, about Dr. Black, and
        about the other missionaries in the office. There have been some
        problems recently between secretaries, but luckily I get along with
        all 3 of them. It was probably the shortest interview that I have had,
        but anytime I talk with President Hansen it is always and edifying
        experience. On the weekend we didnt get a lot of time to proselyte. I
        had to finish up a lot of things in the office for the next month, and
        the church planned payment schedule made it pretty necessary to go to
        the office on Saturday. I got it done though, so life is good. We had
        our Noche de Hermanamiento on Thursday. It started out with about 4
        people there, including me and Elder Prado. At the end we had 35
        people, which is pretty good for our standards. This week´s Noche de
        Hermanamiento should be pretty good. We are doing a play that makes
        fun of Facebook, Twitter, and all that. It is supposed to show
        everyone that there are more important things. Hopefully it turns out
        well. Sunday night we were able to teach one less active guy, Wilson.
        He has been less active for about a year, and before that he was 2nd
        counselor in the bishopric and other callings. He wants to come back,
        but he is lazy and has had problems with some members. He is really
        open to talk to us though and we will probably end up having him show
        us around because he knows the people and he really likes teaching. I
        realized in that lesson that the most important tool we have is our
        testimony. People can debate our facts with other facts, our
        scriptures with other scriptures, but when we use our testimonies we
        cant be beat. Oh, another interesting thing that happened was a
        missionary was bitten by a black widow. Now, in the USA that isnt a
        pleasant thing, but I assume it is controlled easy. Here, it is a
        different story. By the time they got to the hospital, he wasnt really
        breathing and they had to take him to emergency. He was in the
        hospital for about a week. I was there taking them (he and his
        companion Elder Kenney (steven braun´s cousin) food and we decided it
        is preferable to jump out a 3rd story window than get bit by a black
        widow in Bolivia. For the whole time he looked so rough and the pain
        seems terrible. I dont wish that on anyone. Best part of the week is
        that I finished the Book of Mormon. It is the best book ever. I am
        sure it was written by the power of God and I cant deny its power. It
        just makes everything so peaceful when I read it and it makes me so
        happy. Moroni 7 is one of the best chapters I have found. I marked all
        of it basically because every scripture seemed important. I especially
        like verse 39. Today as a zone we first played soccer and then we
        played wally (like indoor volleyball). It was super fun and it gave us
        the opportunity to wear our new zone shirts, which look awesome. We
        used the native Bolivian/Andean flag, the Wiphala, as part of it and
        it looks awesome. Anyways, that is my week. It wasnt too exciting. I
        put the title because it involves pioneers and how I feel.
        Surprisingly enough, the church members celebrated Pioneer day with
        festivals and stuff. As far as my mission is right now, nothing is too
        exciting or working out super well, but I just gotta put my shoulder
        to the wheel and push along. Eventually I will get to the metaphorical
        Salt Lake valley of this part of my mission. Not sure what it is, but
        I am sure it is coming. I love you guys so much and thank you for
        always writing me. I love hearing how things are going. Love you, talk
        to you next week.<br>

                        <p>Back to the grind. I had to get up and go to the airport with Christensen to drop off the tramites guys. We kinda just stayed there the rest of the morning (the airport) to study. After that we went to the district meeting. It was good, Christensen is a creative teacher. He always uses little activities to teach which is cool. After that we went to lunch, and then to the office. Then I started the zone leader meetings. I got something cool today. Elder Feddock, the old Presidential Secretary, brought me a list of people that he used to teach in Cobija when he was here. That should help us out. Other than that it was pretty normal. I finished all the financieros that I had, and by days end I was tired. Maybe nothing glamourous, but I got my job done efficiently and quickly today, and I feel good.</p>

                        <p>Well, I can't really remember much of today, so it'll be a short entry. 2 things stand out from today. First is that we still can't use water in our house. It flat out sucks. Going to the bathroom outside, not taking showers, etc... Not even sure why we don't have water, but they told us that tomorrow we should be fine. We started off thinking it would just be one day, so this is terrible (6 days). Hopefully we get it tomorrow. The other thing is that we had an office staff meeting. It went like this; Christensen explained everything he does and the Hansens really like him. Calderon made it seem like he does literally everything in the office and more. Prado apparently isn't doing everything he should in the office. Bagley does money. It was like everyone talked about their stuff a lot, and then my job can be explained in one word, "money". After the meeting it was just a regular day. I'm starting to get really tired of not having water, so hopefully we get it soon.</p>

                        <p>Happy Pioneer Day!!! Doesn't really mean a lot in Bolivia, but it is my only day of Utah pride. 10 day, like yesterday, didn't have a lot that happened. Just 2 main things really. First, I had my interview with Pres Hansen. It was really... short. I don't think it took longer than 5 minutes. He basically just asked where I was from how Prado is doing, how much we work in the office, and told me that he likes me. It's probably because I already know him well, but I was a little dissappointed. The same thing happened to Christensen too. The rest of the morning we just talked to Elder Jarrell about basketball. The afternoon was just normal, and at night we had our Noche de Hermanamiento. The chapel was locked until 7:20ish, and no one else was there, so I didn't even think we would have it. Gradually, people started coming and we ended up with 35 people there. It was a good enough turnout. Best part of the day is that we have water now. I've never been so grateful for running water. We made it almost a week, which is the longest I could've gone. It's just things like this that make me grateful for what I have in Utah.</p>

                        <p>Today was relatively lackluster. Just going to the office regularly. I have finished any important work, so I'm kinda bored in the office. That's the most important thing is to have something to do. One good thing about today was reading Moroni 7. It is a great chapter. I don't think I could ever believe it was written by a mere man. I liked verse 39 that basically says that if we don't have faith, we aren't fit to be members. That stuck with me. Just being a member (or missionary) isn't enough, we have to still have faith. That was my boring day, I'll try to make the others more interesting.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>Saturdays are usually the longest days of the week. Not sure why, but it's the truth. Today was kinda regular I guess. In the morning I had to go into the office to finish some  things and then I had to go to the bank. On the way to the bank, I saw Chido, this guy that worked for Jorge from Jardin. After the bank we had lunch with the Flia Vargas. The husband isn't super active, but the wife is great. She always listens to Mormon Channel and visited Salt Lake once. We also met her daughter who lives in Barrio Colon. It seems like the older members here are super faithful, but generally people that have been baptized recently are a little bit flaky. After lunch I had to go back to the office to finish some things. At 5 we went to our ward mission meeting and then at 6 there was a baptism in Ingavi that we went to. I had to direct and participate in a musical number. After that I went with Calderon to go give food to people in the clinic. I had a nice chat with him about life and stuff. Elder Garcia is the one in the hospital. He got bit by a black widow, which seems terrible. I would rather get hit by a truck. Then we just went to dinner, then home. Not the craziest day, but it was good.</p>

                        <p>Today was frustrating, but it turned out well. Church was regular from some reason, Prado started doing push-ups in the Gospel Principles class, to which Christensen responded "I feel like Prado isn't 100% there". A mostly true statement. After church we ate with the Flia Salazar. They are a super cool family. We just talked about missions, which is the subject 80% of the time we eat with members. On the way home I told Prado that he was in charge for the day. He got lost walking to our house, which was a bad start. Then he spent 30min thinking of what to do. We ended up leaving the house at 5. We couldn't find anything, until about 6:30. We met a less active named Wilson Arispe. He was a super active member before, even in the bishopric, but he had some problems and hasn't been in a year. He is a good guy though. I realized that the most important thing I can do is to bare my testimony. It is the deepest, most spiritual, and most powerful tool that we have. I need to use it more. That is what happened today. Started out frustrating with Prado, but it turned out well at the end.</p>

                        <p>P-day!!! Today was a good one. We started out at 9 playing soccer with the missionaries from Chimba. It was cool because there we picked up our zone shirts. Definitely the coolest zone shirt I've seen. Soccer was fun and after we just did internet like normal. After that we went to go play wally with Alamos my old zone. It was pretty fun. My team was me, Christensen, Hna Rossi, Hna Crawford, and Elder Reina. We didn't lose a single game. It's funny too, because Christensen always acts different when he is around girls. After playing we ate pizza with the zone, and then we headed back to the office. We stayed there until about 7, when we went to the chapel to practice for our Noche de Hermanamiento play we are going to do on Thursday. I'll explain it on Thursday, like the whole story and what it is. After that, all 8 of us missionaries piled into 1 taxi and went to dinner. It was a good day, filled with 2 sports and the funny play thing. This should be a relatively boring week, so I hope I get through it.</p>
