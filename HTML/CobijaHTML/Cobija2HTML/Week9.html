            <h1>Week 9 <small>(July 21, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3><Title>Cochabamba Water Wars</Title></h3>
        <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
            This was a slow week that went fast. It seems like it took forever,
         but I cant remember much of what I did. It was kinda up and down, but
         I learned a lot. I also hit 13 months this week. After hitting a year,
         the other months just kinda dont mean as much, but at the same time I
         feel really old. We have some elders here for their visa stuff, and
         one of them is in Churuquella, so we were looking at all of my old
         pictures from there, and I realized that all of that happened like
         9ish months ago. I am also the oldest one, along with Christensen, at
         the pension, and one of the older ones in the zone. I´m just old now.
         Anyways, here is what happened this week.
         <br><br>
         Monday- After our adventure in Pairumani, me and Prado had an FHE with
         the Flia Elias and the Bishop´s family. The Flia Elias, not sure if I
         have mentioned them before, is a less active mom and her 3 non member
         children. They recently decided to come back to church. First the
         Hermanas were teaching them, then we did, and now it is kind of a
         split. Prado gets along well with the son Sebastian, so he set up an
         FHE. It was pretty good. The bishop´s family is super cool. The bishop
         is just full of energy all the time and likes missionaries. He works
         as the temple the watchman guy, so he misses church sometimes because
         of work. When he can though, he likes to help us. We also got to talk
         to the Bishop´s brother, who was in the La Paz mission when 2
         missionaries got shot. It was cool to learn a little bit more of what
         happened. We taught a lesson on the Holy Ghost and then played some
         games. It was good to get the Flia Elias integrated with the ward.
         They should get baptized eventually. Not sure if it will be us or the
         Hermanas, but it doesnt really matter.
         <br><br>
         Tuesday- Just an all around long day in the office. I always just sit
         in my desk all day talking to the ZLs about money. I always just get
         home on Tuesday really tired. I really like the Zone Leaders, but it
         is always a long day
         <br><br>
         Wednesday- Cant remember, probably office related things and all that
         <br><br>
         Thursday- Just regular office stuff, except we had our Noche de
         Hermanamiento at night. It is always a surprise who is going to show
         up. We are learning how to make them better though. We did an activity
         where we signed the banner of liberty and all that. It was good
         enough.
         <br><br>
         Friday- The most boring day, but I learned something. I basically just
         stayed in the office all day. Sometimes it is hard as a secretary
         because there has never been any success in this area recently, so we
         always are left with the decision of going out and searching for
         people, or staying in the office and getting caught up with work. I
         realized though that when we are in the office too long, the day just
         turns out bad. I also realized that every day of my life should be a
         day where I can say I accomplished something. If I just do boring
         work, my day isnt really worth anything. I have now but the goal of
         accomplishing something, however small, everyday that makes me proud
         of that day.
         <br><br>
         Saturday- Woohoo, we didnt go to the office. At like 10:30 we went
         with Christensen and Calderon to do the kiosk. Basically we put up a
         kiosk and waited for people to talk to us about it. It is kinda
         boring, but for like 15 minutes of the 2 hours, all 4 of us were
         talking to someone at the same time, which is what we want. It was fun
         to at least to be outside. We ate lunch with this mom and her 2
         daughters, the Flia Daduki. They gave us a lot of food, but I slowly
         finished. After that we went and visited this active/inactive special
         needs hermana in our ward, Hna Teresa. She cant really walk well and
         cant see, so she doesnt really come to church. She gets really lonely
         and had just been robbed by an indigenous cholita, so she was pretty
         down. She was super happy to get visited, so even though we wont
         really have a baptism or anything like that from it, it was worth it.
         After that, we had a meeting with our ward mission leader in the
         chapel. We didnt have keys, so when we came out, the gate was locked.
         So me, Prado, the WML, and the 2 Hermanas had to climb the fence to
         get out. It was pretty fun actually. All my pictures are from that.
         Then we ate dinner with a recent convert and went home.
         <br><br>
         Sunday- We started by going to Hno Nacho´s house to take a shower (I
         will explain why later). He is a member of the other ward here and is
         the main supplier for the mission. He is super cool and we always
         spend time with him and his family. He also gave us breakfast which
         was cool. Church was normal. I had to give the Gospel Principles class
         because our regular teacher isnt very reliable. After church we ate
         with the Flia Alegre, the family of the 2nd counselor. He served in
         California and lived in Provo, so everytime we talk to him we talk
         about the states. After that we went out to work again. I kinda got
         discouraged because no one wanted to listen to us, but we finally got
         some lady to listen to us by contacting in the park. This area is
         kinda tough, so we are looking for a solution to help us find people
         to teach. It was kind of a long day just cause we couldnt find anyone,
         but it was better than being in the office. Me and Christensen spent
         the rest of the night after dinner watching mormon messages.
         <br><br>
         Monday- We played soccer as a zone against another zone today. I
         really like soccer, but it is different as a missionary. It is like my
         brain still thinks I can do everything, so I am in the right spot all
         the time, but I dont have the ability really anymore. I only scored
         once, even though I had like 7 chances. It was fun because Elder
         Valerio in my zone played at Alta and for Blue Knights, and Elder
         Tronson from the other zone played for Provo and Rangers, so we just
         talked soccer and it was fun. The latinos were really annoying. There
         were 2 that just played like little girls and would fall down and cry
         about fouls that whole time. Me and Christensen were ready to go punch
         one of them cause he was just annoying. Overall, it was a good
         experience, regardless of latinos that play like little girls. We ate
         lunch as a zone, and I met some guy from Bolivia that lives in Texas
         and was really confused as to why there were like 10 white kids eating
         in Bolivia. I tried to get a reference from him, but he didnt really
         want anything.
         <br><br>
         So, the reason I named the email the Cochabamba Water Wars (a protest
         that happened in like 2001 or something) is because Saturday night we
         found out that we cant use our water until Tuesday. For that reason,
         we had to go to Nacho´s house to take a shower. It is terrible to not
         have water. I never realized how grateful I am for running water.
         Hopefully we can get it back tomorrow, or it is going to be a long
         week. Hopefully this week will be good though, because on Wednesday we
         have an office meeting with the Hansens, and Thursday I have my
         interview with him. I love you guys so much, and I will talk to you
         next week.
         <br><br>
         Love,<br>
   Elder Bagley

                        <p>Just a regular Tuesday. I got up, studied, gave Prado a small pep talk, then we headed to the district meeting. Elder Christensen taught on reaching our potential and using the small things as a base. He also brought treats. It was a good class. We also started designing our zone t-shirt, which should turn out pretty cool. After lunch I just had my regular meetings with the ZLs. I like that part of my job because it allows me to become good friends with the ZLs. Other than that, I just had to talk to Pres Hansen about reimbursing something (he asked my opinion because he's not sure on some things sometimes). It was a fairly boring day, but Tuesdays are usually like that.</p>

                        <p>Wow, July is already half way over. Time goes really fast. Today was interesting. We got up and studied and stuff. I didn't get up on time, which is frustrating. That is the hardest thing for me to get up on time. Prado got to study at 8:30. It's still not good, but it's better than before. We read the BoM and he learned the phrase "hither and thither" which was funny. We got to the office around 11. I basically hid in my office because E' Hernandez was there for his interview, and I just really don't want to have any awkwardness. Still don't get why he hates me, but oh well. I successfully avoided him though, so mission accomplished. After lunch we just headed back to the office. Me and E' Christensen were making a bunch of jokes about things being confidential, because Calderon likes to tell everyone he does confidential things. I went to buy envelopes and some random was fascinated with my last name. We ended the day with dinner. We keep joking in the pension that everything is for "todo el mes". Life is good overall, boring at times, but good.</p>

                        <p>Today just kinda happened. It was really quick. Prado is improving everyday. Tuesday he started studying at 9, wednesday at 8:30, today at 8:10. We are getting really close to being on time. At 10ish we went to the office, but we immediately left to go to the bank so I could finally take out my money after waiting for like a week. After that we went to lunch and then back to the office. There I had to resolve and interesting situation with Elder calderon. I basically had to take a phone away from him and find where to put it. We ended up giving it to Elder Christensen. I tried to handle it fairly and not favor anyone. I think I did ok. There is a whole lot of contention between the APs and Calderon, so it'll be interesting to see if anything happens. At night we went to the Noche de Hermanamiento. It had more people than last week. We signed a standard of liberty and I played around with the bishop's youngest son Juan Carlos. AFter dinner we went to buy food and as always, the lady in the store was playing Dr. Mario on her supernintendo. Only in Bolivia. It was a quick day, the week is going fast.</p>

                        <p>Today was pretty boring. I got kinda annoyed with Prado in the morning because he got to study at 8:10, but then at 8:40 he went to go make breakfast. I just want him there from 8-10. I don't think it is too much to ask. Oh well, after that, we went to the office. I didn't really have much work to do. I spent a bit of time just talking to E' Mickle and E' Skousen. After lunch wasn't much better. I just went to pay the light bill, and that was my biggest adventure. I did realize something today though. I need to make everyday worth it. I shouldn't have days where I can't say I did something important. My new goal is just to make everyday memorable. That's it for today, well we don't have water, but other than that that's all that happened.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>Wooooooo, 13 months! It's kinda lost the feeling now. Every month between 13 and 23 is gonna feel the same. Getting up to 12 was big, but I'm on the way down now. This morning we found out we won't have water until Tuesday, which really sucks. We studied and all that well, and we didn't go to the office once. At 10L30, we went (the 4 of us) to do the kiosk thing. It is pretty boring, but it is better than the office. We had lunch with the Flia Daduki. It is a mom and her 2 daughters. They are pretty cool. Hna Hansen was super sick. We had a good time with the family. I like eating with members when they are cool members. After that we went to go visit this lady, Teresa. She was accidentally called by the Ingavi elders, but then she wanted them to visit her, so they sent us. She has some physical problems and can't go to church, but has a testimony. Her mom was robbed by a cholita this morning, and she was a bit traumitized bu it, but said we helped. Even though it won't result in a baptism, I was glad to help her feel better. She also speaks english, which is always cool. She was really grateful that we went, so I felt good. After that we had our ward mission meeting thing. It was good, except when we left the chapel all the gates were closed, so us, the Hermanas, and the WML all had to climb the fence. To finish the night, we ate with Lucinda Chavez. It was a good day, and I'm glad we didn't have to go to the office for once.</p>

                        <p>I've never been more grateful for water than now. The water has been unavailable to us since Saturday because of construction. I miss running water so much. We went over to Nacho's house in the morning to take showers. It felt so good and they gave us breakfast too. Church was good enough. I felt really tired though. I taught the 2nd hour class because the regular teacher never wants to teach the class. After church we went to eat lunch with the Flia Alegre. He's one of the counselors, and lived in Utah and served in California, so he knows a lot about the states. They're a really nice family. After that we went out and worked again. We tried to visit some less actives, but they either weren't home or didn't want to talk to us. We only found 1 girl/snake that we set an appointment with, and we taught a JW. After that I had a good long tlak with Prado about how to improve. Hopefully he actually acts on it this time. I've been discouraged in the field recently, so I'm trying to break out of it. We are little by little progressing, and that's all I can ask for. P-day tomorrow, woooo!

                        <p>Today was a fun p-day. We got up, went to the office to go to the bathroom and then we went to go play soccer. We kind of got lost on the way there, but we eventually got there. We played with Zone Jaihuayco. There zone is full of macaneros. When they all showed up you could feel the difference in the atmosphere. Playing soccer was really fun. Elder Valerio and Elder Tronson both played before the mission, so it felt like the good ole days. I should've scored like 7 times, but I hit the post, got really close, or just plain messed up. I scored once on a header, but that was it. It was tiring to play, since I haven't played like that in like 2 years. The Jaihuayco zone was really annoying. They were really whimpy, thought they were the best ever, and, just played like little girls. It was relaly annoying and I really wanted to knock them over. It was really funny though because the Hnas on our team were tougher than the elders on the other team. Hna Crawford, Capito, and Rumualdo were beating up the Jaihuayco elders. 2 event went to the hospital after for a bruised rib and a hurt toe. Not that it is good to hurt people, but it was funny. After that we went and ate lunch as a zone (I talked to some random Bolivian and he spoke english and lived in Texas. I tried to contact him, but he didn't want anything.) I got to become better friends with Elder Tronson and Elder Nielsen which was cool. Then we just wrote our families and finished the day. At dinner Hna Lazarte gave us a ncie humility speech because the secretaries are always prideful. I'll try to apply it more. It was a good day, but my legs are so dead they don't move anymore.</p>
