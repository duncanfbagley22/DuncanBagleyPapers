            <h1>Week 11 <small>(August 4, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3><Title>Here Come the Men in Black/White</Title></h3>
        <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
            I sat here for like 5 minutes trying to think of what the title
        would be. I came up with this one, that has a double meaning, which I
        will explain later. Anyways, this was a pretty good week. Had some
        interesting experiences. I am going to explain it all day by day,
        because this week was a little bit more exciting, so I can do that
        this. So this is what happened...<br>
        Monday- We just played wally like I said and that was that. I also
        think today is when we went to go get the kid that got bit by the
        black widow out of the hospital. I think half the mission is going to
        call him spiderman now.<br>
        Tuesday- Regular meetings with the ZLs of Cochabamba. I actually enjoy
        Tuesdays because there are people to talk to instead of just sitting
        in my office by myself. Basically the only major human interaction I
        get between Tuesday and Wednesday besides lunch and dinner. I also had
        to pay all of the missionaries in the whole mission, for their rent,
        sustento, and pension money. Anytime I do that it makes me realize
        that they really trust me here. Otherwise, I dont think they´d give
        some little 20yr old from east Salt Lake control of that much money.
        Wednesday- Nothing of much importance<br>
        Thursday- We had our Noche de Hermanamiento. It was really fun. We did
        a play about technology with us 4 missionaries, the 4 from the other
        ward, and a girl in our ward. Here is the basics: There is a girl that
        gets home from school and has homework. The Holy Ghost, Elder
        Christensen, tries to help her, but she doesnt want to study. Her mom
        comes in and tells her to do it, but that doesnt work either.
        Randomly, "applications" come in trying to distract her. Applications
        like Facebook, Google, and Instagram. Later a virus infects the girl,
        but the Men in Black (me and Elder Prado) come in and destroy it.
        Finally, the spirit gets offended because the girl wont listen, and
        she just is left alone with some weird dark spirit and gets all
        depressed. She prays and the Holy Ghost comes back and saves her. The
        end. I have the video, so I will send it on dropbox.<br>
        Friday- Nothing too special. I saw 2 really good mormon messages. One
        is The Hope of God´s Light, and the other is Mountains to Climb. I can
        almost guarentee that mom cant watch the second one without crying.
        Heck, I almost cried like 3 times watching it. I dont think I will
        ever understand why people think we are evil or devilish people when
        we produce such cool and inspiring videos and books and stuff.<br>
        Saturday- So in the morning and most of the afternoon we were in the
        office finishing some things. At like 4ish we went to go help clean
        the chapel. We also met with our WML, Rodrigo. He used to be lazy and
        didnt really like us, but recently he is ridiculously awesome. He is
        helping a lot. After that I had an imaginary gun fight with the
        bishop´s 2 yr old son Juan Carlos aka Juanki (Juan-key). At night we
        had an appointment with Wilson Arispe, a less active that we visited
        last week. He started praying again, so that is progress. He knows
        everything and has a bunch of cool experiences with the church and the
        temple and stuff. He also promised that he would go to church on
        Sunday.<br>
        Sunday- Well, Wilson went to church! Even though there is still a lot
        of work left, I was so stinkin happy. After 2 months of little actual
        missionary work, seeing success is awesome. He came in all smiling and
        stuff. It was awesome. After church and lunch we went out to work. We
        had an appointment, but it fell through, so we went to contact people.
        We have a talent. Everytime we walk towards someone or talk about
        going and talking to someone, they get up and leave. Literally, 80% of
        the time. Even if they cant see us. One time 3 people got up and left
        in the space of 5 seconds. It is like some small voice comes and says
        "Here comes the Men in White, get up and leave". Occasionally we find
        people that will listen though. We talked to a few good people. Elder
        Prado sneakily sits down on the bench with them and starts up a random
        conversation which we then convert to us teaching. It is actually
        pretty effective. To end the night we had something cool to do. Now,
        like a few weeks ago I read that Seth went to go teach with member of
        the 70. Ours isnt that cool, but we received a reference from a former
        area seventy/mission president. Elder Vladimir Cabrero from Santa
        Cruz. He was mission president in Ukraine (weird right?). His nephew
        wanted a BoM and lived in our area. So we went and dropped off the BoM
        and set an appointment. It is cool to see that the GAs of the church
        actually practice what they preach. That means everyone should help in
        the work.<br>
        Monday- I woke up at 5am to a familiar voice. I heard someone shout
        "BAGLEY!" from outside the house. It was Elder Harris, my buddy from
        Sucre. Him and a few others had gotten to Cocha to do visa stuff.
        Elder Christensen and Elder Calderon had left at 4 30 to go pick them
        up from the terminal, but I guess they just came on their own. So then
        I had to get up and unlock the door, then go and drop the lone Hermana
        that was with them off at another sister´s house. Then at 6 we went to
        go play futsal in the park (we played on Friday and Saturday morning
        as well). I have been up since 5, so I am kinda tired. Today we are
        going to have a paint fight for P day. It should be interesting to say
        the least.<br>
        Overall, it was a productive week, especially Sunday. I was super
        tired Sunday cause I am not used to all the walking. It felt good
        though. This week is full of stuff. We are going to the temple on
        Thursday, Wednesday the 6th is Bolivian Independence day, and Sunday
        is cambios. We also have a few appointments with new people. I am
        excited for it. I love you all and I will talk to you next week.<br>

                        <p>Today was rather annoying. Everything was fine up until 9. I got up, studied, and did all that. Literally right as I finished my prayer, the Potosi zone called and urgently needed money. So, I had to run all over the city (office, correo, etc). I was getting really frustrated in the office because I was late for the district meeting. Anytime I'm late I automatically get frustrated. We ended up getting to the meeting with about 10min left. I feel bad getting there late because Christensen prepares a class for us. After the meeting and lunch, I just headed to the office to have the ZL meetings. It was fun. I get along really well with the zone leaders, so half the time it doesn't even feel like work. After a couple hours in my chai without moving, it gets kind of boring though. That was the extent of my day. It wasn't that hard, but it was kind of stressful. People think secretaries are like school teachers, where we just live at work and never do anything else. My morale has been down lately, and I don't know why. Something I'll be looking to fix.</p>

                        <p>Wow, exactly a year ago today, I arrived in Bolivia. Just thinking about how much this year has influenced my life is crazy. I'm completely different. I remember how Lopez told me that when he first saw me he didn't want to be my companion because I just looked boring and mad all the time. I like to think that I am a lot different now. A happy guy that is exciting more or less. This has been the most important year of my life. That being said, today was kinda boring. I can't really think of any super important things. Today I made the payment to all the missionaries. It was about 450,000bs or like $65,000. Not a gigantic amount of money, but for a random 20yr old kid it is pretty big. Before we left the office, we put up my nerf basketball hoop and shot around a little bit. That was probably the highlight of the day which is sad. Tomorrow is the last day of July; time goes by really fast. </p>

                        <h3>July 31, 2014</h3>
                        <p>Today was a fund day. In the morning, we just regularly went to the office. Around 12ish we went to the chapel to pick up some teaching material. Like 25000 pamphlets and some Books of Mormon in Portuguese. To me, Portuguese is just spanish that is drunk. It'd be cool to learn it though. After that, and lunch, we went to the chapel to practice for our little play we did tonight. After that we just went to the office. I didn't really have much to do today. At 7ish we got to the chapel to do our play. This is the summary: There is a teenage girl that gets home from school and needs to do her homework. The Holy Ghost (E' Christensen) tries to influence her to do her homework, but she ignores him. Randomly, people come in pretending to be applications of a phone, like Facebook (E' Calderon), Google (H' Llanos) and Instagram (H' Capito), and they keep her from doing her homework. Hermana Hansen (FamilySearch.org) comes in to try to have her do geneology, but she ignores her. Calderon is later a virus that tries to infect her (the girl was Camila a girl in our ward). Me and Prado come in as the Men in Black, music and all, to destroy the virus. Finally, I go in as a bad spirit to take over because the Holy Ghost is offended and doesn't help. The girl prays, and the Holy Ghost saves her. The end. It was to show the good and bad of technology. I think it went over well. It was pretty fun and we had a good number of people there. That was the highlight of the day for sure. Something else cool happened, but it was yesterday after I finished writing. I decided to kneel down and ask God if the BoM is true. Now, I believed it was, but never had a true, definite answer. Last night, I think I got one. I just got a different feeling, like out of body. When I opened my eyes it was like I hadn't been there for a few minutes. It wasn't an experience where I saw an angel or heard a voice, but I'm at the point where I don't think I could ever reject the validaty of the book. It's just too powerful. Anyways, I believe it is a true book written and translated by prophets of God. Whoever reads this journal one day should go read the book and pray about it. The Book of Mormon is in my opinion, the most powerful book on earth.</p>

                        <p>Woohoo, starting a new journal, #3. It is crazy that August has already started. On this day last year, I arrived in Sucre nervous and not being able to speak spanish. That was a big day of my life, today... not so much. We played soccer in the morning, us 4 and Hna Rumualdo and Capito. It was pretty fun. Whatever it takes to get me some exercise. We just had a regular day after that. In the morning me, Christensen, and Valerio planned what we think/want the ends of our missions to be like. I want to end up in Tupiza. That took up most of the morning. The afternoon was similar, but it was Saad and weekes in my office. I tried to work, but there were a lot of distractions. I hate staying in the office, but it is more productive than knocking doors. Towards the end of the night, I watched some Mormon Messages. There was one called "Mountains to Climb" or something like that. It almost got me to cry like 3 times. Church is true. Hopefully tomorrow is a little bit more entertaining than today.</p>

                        <p>Today had the good, the boring, and the ugly. It started out good, we went and played soccer again with the Hermanas. It was fun and good exercise. The morning consisted of going to the office to resolve some issues. After that we headed to lunch with the Flia Perez. They are some of the first members here. They went to church back when Cocha had 1 branch. Now it has 5 stakes. After lunch, we had to go back to the office. The only good part was I found a way to hopefully save our budget. After dropping of the kiosk in Chimba, we went to the chapel for our mission meeting and to help clean the chapel. I had an imaginary gun fight with the bishop's son Juan Carlos. After that, and walking around for a while, we visited Wilson Arispe. He prayed this week, which is good because that was the commitment. He said he's coming to church tomorrow too. He's doing well. After getting home, I thought everything was going to be fine and calm. However, Prado called the Flia Rua to confirm lunch tomorrow. I didn't hear that conversation, but when I got upstairs the Rua daughter called Prado and was very offended by the way Prado spoke with her mom. I sent an apology text, but tomorrow we'll see how it is. Leave it to Prado to offend the lady giving lunch to us tomorrow on her B-day. Hopefully it'll turn out ok.</p>

                        <p>Finally we had a little bit of success. After getting up and going to ward council, we went and sat in the chapel. About 10 minutes in to the meeting, Wilson Arispe showed up. I was sooooooo happy. He was all grinning and stuff. That was the best feeling ever. Finally got someone to go to church. Hopefully he can keep going and progressing. Geez, I'm still happy about it. After church, we ate with the Flia Rua. I was expecting it to be awkward, but it was fine. The food was kinda weird, but overall it was fine. On the way out, Steve ran over to say hi, we are basically best friends now. Throughout the rest of the day, we worked pretty hard. we were walking all over the place, contacting and setting up appointments. If we keep this up, we should be able to have a little bit of success. To end the night, we went to go contact a reference from an area 70. Elder Vladimir Campero from Santa Cruz sent a reference to contact his nephew. We weren't able to teach, but he is really nice and wants to learn. We'll have an appointment later. Well, my legs are super tired from walking all day, so I'm going to sleep now.</p>

                        <p>Today was a fun p-day. I randomly was woken up at 5 hearing "Bagley!!!". I looked outside and saw Elder Harris, Elder Crankshaw, and Hermana Brindley outside. They came for tramites. We had to take Brindley to Ingavi's house, and then we ended up playing soccer with the tramites people and the hermanas. At 10:30 we went and did internet. I had the hard task of writing to Griffin, as he leaves next week. I am excited/nervous, it's kinda weird. After that we went to Friday's with the tramites guys. Fridays always makes me feel like I'm in the USA. On the way in we saw Elder Jensen and the temple missionaries eating in the food court. After eating lunch, we went to a field and had a paint fight with the zone. Even though it had little planning, it actually turned out really fun. It only lasted a few minutes, but we got some great pictures after (especially me, Christensen, and Valerio). It took forever to wash off, but it was worth it. Our zone continues to be the best zone ever.</p>
