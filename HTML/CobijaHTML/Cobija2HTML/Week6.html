            <h1>Week 6 <small>(June 30, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch/Oh Danny Boy</h3>
            <p><small>Dearest family,<br>
                This was a week full of changes. Actually, there was just one
            cambio, but it involved the president, so it is pretty big. I dont
            really have many important events from this week, but this is more or
            less what happened...<br>
            Monday- Probably explained it last week, but we played soccer and it
            was fun enough.<br>
            Tuesday- We had zone and district meetings. It wasnt anything special
            or spectacular or anything, but it was good.<br>
            Wednesday- The tramites people showed up at our house. I dont like
            having everyone over at our house because it just complicates
            everything. I prefer to just have the 4 of us in the house, but when
            we have like 8, and we have to run around trying to find people to
            have them eat with or have something to do and then all of them bug me
            about money all day, it is kinda annoying. Even when they are
            missionaries we like, it is kinda annoying. We also had our last zone
            conference with the Dyers. It is so crazy how fast this year with them
            has gone. I have a bunch of good photos of them when they were dressed
            up in Bolivian clothing. They are so great. Obviously, their last
            words were really important. Hermana Dyer first spoke on choosing a
            spouse. You should´ve seen all of the people taking notes. I have
            never seen 100 missionaries so focused before. She gave us like 12
            important points and told us the save the paper and read it again
            after the mission. They also told the story of how they first met. One
            of President Dyer´s old companions introduced them. It is funny
            because I was sitting there with Muñoz, Pinta, Prado, and Christensen
            all at the same time, so maybe one of them can help me find a wife.
            Them telling the story was just super funny. I miss the Dyers so much.
            President Dyer picked one thing to focus on as his last words. He
            spoke on tithing. Not too important for a bunch of missionaries, but
            obviously something really important for us if it was his last
            message. We also got to go say goodbye (even though I knew it wasnt
            goodbye cause I would see them at the airport) in a big line. It was
            our one and only time to hug a girl on the mission, Hna Dyer. It was
            cool, because when we went to go talk to President Dyer privately he
            would take us over for a second and give us some last inspiring words.
            It was awesome. He told me a bunch of cool things. He told me that I
            was definitely called by inspiration. He even got a little emotional
            talking about it. He said he doesnt know exactly why I am in the
            office, but he knows that it is because I need to be here. Definitely
            wrote down everything in my journel.<br>
            Thursday- Nothing really, except I closed down President and Hermana
            Dyer´s accounts. It was kinda complicated, but finally I got
            everything zeroed out and sent everything in, so it was all set.<br>
            Friday- The big day. We got up at like 5:30 because President Hansen
            was to arrive at 7. We got there and welcomed them here and stuff.
            President Hansen is like 6´4, so he is bigger than all of us. He is
            Mark W Hansen (his name is included in the title, ask Griff, I am sure
            he understands what that is). Go check out his website, he has big
            name clients. They are both super nice, but they quickly went home to
            sleep because they travelled all night. Around 12ish they came to the
            office and I explain what it is that I do. I didnt really get to talk
            with them very much, but they are really nice. They seem kinda
            overwhelmed, which is understandable. It was hard to be a regular
            missionary, so being a president seems like a lot. They are getting
            the hang of it though. At night we had to say bye to the Dyers. It was
            super weird to say bye to them. It was cool at the beginning because
            Sonia, Benita, Joel, and Eileen showed up to say bye too, so I got to
            see them. Earlier in the week, Hermana Dyer gave us some of President
            Dyer´s ties. I got a nice red one, and when we went to the airport we
            had President Dyer sign the back. He said the one I had was his
            favorite, so I will keep it safe. We said bye and watched them slowly
            get on the plane and leave. President Dyer (Dan L Dyer, that is the
            other half of the title) was just cracking jokes the whole time to
            avoid being sad, but Hermana Dyer was obviously crying. It was hard to
            see them go, but they were ready. 3 years is a long time.<br>
            Saturday- We took a picture with the assistants and us 4 (I will send
            it next week), and then went to the office to finish some stuff. We
            ate lunch with the Kennedy family. He is a gringo from Oklahoma and
            his wife is Bolivian. They met in the states and now they live here.
            He is super funny and both of them speak english and spanish, and
            their kids speak a mixture, so the whole lunch was confusing. After
            that we went to the chapel and planned some activities with the WML
            (suddenly he loves us) and the hermanas. We should start to see some
            progress soon. I will attach the fliers I made for the little
            activities we do every Thursday. We tried really hard not to go to the
            office, but I had to make the fliers so we ended up going anyways.
            Sunday- Just regular church. We are slowly seeing improvement in the
            ward and I think there is success waiting for us. We ate lunch with
            the bishop and his family and they are super awesome. He really is
            excited for missionary work and wants to help. We actually had a
            lesson too. Me and Prado want to start working (no one has ever worked
            here really, our area book is a disaster). We met this guy named
            Fernando and even though he is set in his church, he is interested in
            the BoM. Maybe he wont turn out, but at least we have a start. After
            that me and Prado just had a good talk about how we can improve and
            what we want to do. He is immature sometimes, but he is a good kid. We
            are going to try really hard to get something going.<br>
            Monday- We went to go bowling, but it was closed, so we just ate
            lunch. Then we went and played basketball. It was fun, but I am so out
            of shape, or maybe I am in missionary shape, but it is hard to run up
            and down all the time. We are hoping to play soon with President
            Hansen because he supposedly plays. Now, for the best moment of the
            week. I was walking with Prado up to the chapel, and I saw someone
            coming towards us. I realized that I recognized her. It was Andrea
            from El Paso. She would always come with us to appointments and stuff.
            I then realized she was walking with Rosella, one of our converts in
            El Paso. Now for the best part. I asked where they were coming from
            and it was from institute. Woohoo! She goes to institute. She also is
            a beehive teacher in the ward. She is doing great and says that they
            all miss me. I will probably go by in a few weeks to go visit
            everyone. I like seeing converts that are active. That was the
            highlight of the day by far.<br><br>
            
            So that was my week. We are still trying to help out President Hansen
            as much as we can, but he came in tonight and they seem a little more
            accustomed. Anyways, I love you guys, and I will talk to you next
            week.<br>
            Love,<br>
               Elder Bagley<br>

                        <p>Today was a long and boring and in some ways stressful day. I started out well. I woke up on time, exercised, studied, and did everything like I always should do. After that, I went with Elder Saad (he is staying with us because Weekes was in Santa Cruz for tramites). We went to to offices and just started working. At 10:30 we went to the district and zone meetings. Because of people visiting here for tramites, there were so many Hnas there. It was a good lesson. Christensen really gives his all while teaching the classes. After lunch, I went back to the offices and starting working. I had a mix of finshing Pres Dyer's finances, doing the zone reimbursements, and stupid tramites missionaries asking for money. I get so tired of just the regular missionaries. They are impatient and think money grows on trees. I get tired of them calling me and always wanting money. On top of that Bishop Godo/Davila (the guy that helps the mission with tramites) convinces missionaries to reimburse things that are not reimbursable like random breakfasts or gas tanks for baptisms. People are stupid. I was getting really stressed about finishing Pres Dyer's finances. I had to send a bunch of emails to Eddy Rocha (the guy in charge of Bolivia for the church's money) asking what to do. I don't relaly want to go to into depth, but the finances were complicated, because of dealing with bolivianos and soles and all that. I'm gonna be glad when it is all over. We were at the office until 10:30ish. Tomorrow might be even longer, so I'm going to go to sleep now.</p>

                        <h3>June 25, 2014</h3>
                        <p>Today was eventful. These last few days are super busy for us. In the morning I went to the office to try to finish with Pres Dyer's money, but Eddy Rocha was busy, so he couldn't help me. So we/me and Elder Calderon brought like 100 bottles of water from the office to the stake center for the conference. It was a great conference (Pres and Hna Dyer's last one). It is kinda weird that it is my last one with them. They talked about a lot of interesting things. There were a few funny things and spiritual things. Funny was that Hna Dyer gave a talk about when her and Pres Dyer met. Basically the whole thing was funny. On top of that was E' Calderon. The other day he gave himself a haircut, and it turned out terrible. He showed up to the conference and everyone just cracked jokes and asked what happened. Pres Dyer even brought it up in front of everyone. Memorable stuff. Now for the spiritual stuff. 3 main points. For Hna Dyer's last words, she spoke on how to choose a spouse. I have everything written down, so I'll read it when the time comes. Second is what Pres Dyer ended with. He spoke on tithing. Weird to talk to missionaries about that, but it is that important. Finally, was what Pres Dyer told me personally when we were all passing by shaking the Dyers' hands. He keeps on emphasizing that he chose me out of revelation. He got emotional talking about it. He said he doesn't know why, but my time here is really important. He said he is interested to see where I go in life. I'm going to miss the Dyers a lot. They've had a big impact on me. After the conference was normal, people bugging me for money. I had like a 30min phone call with Eddy Rocha to help me finish up Pres Dyer's finances. We are all good now. Now all the tramites missionaries are here and being annoying, but they go home tomorrow. Tomorrow will be stressful as well...</p>

                        <p>Today was just normal. We got up early enough to take people to the airport. That wasn't actually my plan, but Calderon slept in so I had to go with Christensen to the airport. We waited a while for 1 sister to show up and then we had to listen to 2 hermanas complain about having a cambio. 1st of all, there's nothing me and Christensen can do. 2nd is that they should just take what comes. 3rd is that the cambio didn't end up happening. Hermanas... After that it was just a regular long day. I finally finished Pres Dyer's finances. It was complicated, because the Dyers kept bringing receipts and wanting dollars, but I finally got it done. Me and Christensen stayed till like 9 at the office, and then went to eat dinner. The pensionista (Bety) and her family are just super cool, so we talk to them all the time about just everything. We got home at like 10, and I had to wash clothes. I fell asleep though and only ended up washing one pair of socks. I need sleep, but tomorrow is the big day.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>The big day. 2 very important things happened today. First, we got to the airport at 6:40 to be there to greet Pres Hansen. We were there to meet them and take pictures and all that. They seem pretty cool and nice. However, kinda like a deer in the headlights, just with how fast everything is moving. I would be too, I can't imagine how hard it would be to be in their place. Anyways, me and E Christensen didn't have much time to meet them because we ran over to the other side of the airport because there was an Hna that had chosen to go home early. Happiness on one side, sadness on the other. Later in the day, the Hansens came by to meet us and learn our jobs. They seem excited to work with us. It'll be a lot different working with them though. We went to lunch, ate really quick, and then we all took 30min naps. I slept in a hammock, it was wonderful. Then we just went back to the office to work. At night we had another important event. We had to say goodbye to the Dyers. Everyone was there. Everyone as in us 6, the Dyers, Sonia, Benita, Joel, Eileen, and Pres and Hna Garcia. I got a tie earlier in the week from the Dyers and Pres Dyer signed it tonight, and told me it is his favorite. It was weird saying goodbye. I know I'll see them again, but they were kind of like parents. We stayed all the way to the end, waving goodbye as wthey got on the plane. It is going to be totally different now with the Hansens, but they were called through inspiration, so they are the right people for the job. It'll be very interesting though to see how the next few weeks go.</p>

                        <p>Well, today wasn't as exciting as yesterday. We got up and went to Fotocenter, where we took a picture (secretaries and assistants). Every cambio they take one. I really like Weekes and Saad. The picture turned out well enough, so we'll keep it. After that we just went to the office to finish up some things. I had to finish with the payments for all the missionaries. Pres Hansen hasn't approved anything though, so we'll just pray the money gets there on time. For lunch we ate at the Kennedy house. They are a Bolivian/American family. The mom is from here while the dad is from Oklahoma. They both speak both languages, and the kids speak and/or understand both, so there is a lot of both languages and it is confusing. The best part was when the middle child, Steve, got out of his chair and made it about 2ft before falling asleep under the table. After lunch we went to a baptism that H Rumualdo and H Capito had. Then we had our ward mission meeting thing. It seems like the WML is finally started to take interest, which is good. We planned for some mission nights in the ward and stuff like that. It was good, but then I had to go print invitations in the office. I need to get out of the office more. It is one of those things that is like a comfort zone now, but I really need to get out more. I need to be more missionary than I am a secretary.</p>

                        <p>Sundays are hard. I woke up at 6:30, but obviously I'm not going to do exercises on a sunday, so I usually just go back to bed. I need to find something to do in the morning. We went to ward council in the morning. There aren't a lot of people that go, but our bishop is awesome and I think ward council can really help us. Church was good. Our ward mission leader really likes us now, like he came and sat by us and everything. Hopefully he'll help us more. In Gospel Principles we had a bunch of random, new investigators showed up. For lunch we ate with the bishop's family. Actually, we were eating at his house, but he went to a restaurant to buy the food because they didn't know we had lunch with them. Oh well, it turned out ok. He is super cool, so he should help the work. His son is also just super funny. After lunch we had a lesson... no really. We got a reference from the Hermanas and went to visit him. His name is Fernando, and is set in his church but he is open to learn. We have an appt next sunday too. I miss teaching, we need to do it more. We ended the night with a planning session. There's a lot we need to get better at, but we'll get there. Prado is humble, so we can make progress. Pres Hansen has texted me asking a few quesitons, and I get scared texting back cause I fear I'll say something wrong. P-day tomorrow, makes life good.</p>

                        <p>Today was rather uneventful. We got up and eventually went to IC Norte. Prado tried to take out money, but he couldn't, so then we just went to Radioshack (never though I'd find Radioshack in Bolivia) so I could buy some speakers. After that we just went to internet. I guess my dad just got called to the YSA ward bishopric. Also, Rachel could possibly start dating this guy. Everyone is doing well. AFter that we went to go bowling, but it was closed, so we just ate salteñas with the zone. Then we went to go play basketball at the Universidad stake center. On the way there we saw none other than Rosella walking with Andrea. They were coming back from institute. That is definitely a great sight. She is still super active and has a calling. It is going well. Basketball was really fun, but I got super tired. I'm out of shape. We played me, Christensen, Phillips, Calderon, Berrett, Weekes, Thomson, Saad, Skousen, Laidlaw, Grigor, Jacobson, and I can't remember who else. It was fun. Then we just went back to the office to work. It was a good enough day, just not very eventful. Tomorrow is July, that is super weird.</p>
