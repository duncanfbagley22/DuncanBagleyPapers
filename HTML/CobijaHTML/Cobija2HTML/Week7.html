            <h1>Week 7 <small>(July 7, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>´CAUSE I´M PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN</h3>
        <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
            I hope you all are doing well. This was a somewhat long week for
        me. I cant really remember well what happened each day, so I am just
        going to talk about some of the more important events in the week. I
        hope it is interesting enough.<br>
               Moving beds- We had to go to the district meeting on Tuesday,
        but we had to take 2 big mattresses there. We called for a taxi with
        one of those things on top to hold things, but just a regular one
        came. So, Elder Christensen solved the problem. We wrapped blankets
        from one window, over the top of the beds, and to the other window on
        the other side of the car. Then we held onto to it for the 15 minute
        car ride. Not sure why we didnt take a picture, but it looked pretty
        cool.<br>
               Zone Leader meetings- Tuesday is easily my longest day. There
        was a point last time where I didnt leave my seat for 2 1/2 hours.
        Then, Elder Christensen, Elder Prado, and Elder Calderon all had to go
        do something outside the office, so I sat there alone... just kidding,
        I was with my ZLs Elder Laidlaw and Elder Severiano for a while. It
        was a rather boring night.<br>
               Prado and Calderon- These 2 are like a roller coaster.
        Sometimes they are awesome, and sometimes they make me want to pull my
        hair out. They are both difficult at times, but in completely
        different ways. Prado is just forgetful and doesnt do his job all the
        time. He just doesnt show a lot of care. Calderon just thinks he is
        the bee´s knees because he is secretary. He got really mad at the APs
        this week and now he doesnt like them very much. There is talk around
        the office that maybe we will switch companionships to where I would
        be with Elder Christensen again. One AP really wants it, one is
        indifferent, and Pres Hansen is thinking about it. There are pros and
        cons, which I explained to the Hansens. Pro is that me and Christensen
        work great together and we have a bigger workload, so we need to be in
        the office more and stuff like that. Con is that we are scared if we
        arent with the other two, they might end up not leaving the office
        ever. I really dont have a preference, for now I am just trying to
        make it work with Prado. He really is a great comp and is slowly
        improving, so thats all I can ask. He isnt bad, just there are times
        where he complicates things. I´ve talked to him though and he is
        trying to get better. He is my first companion that is really humble,
        and I like that.<br>
               Zone Conference- We had our getting to know the President zone
        conference. It was really short, but it was good. President Hansen is
        going to be great for the mission. He has a strong testimony and is
        really working hard. His spanish isnt spectacular...yet, but he is
        getting there and it is enough to explain everything and he can
        understand (unless it is really fast). For a beginner, Hna Hansen isnt
        awful. She can bear her testimony and things like that. During the
        conference they introduced themselves, spoke on a few things, and
        other things. They are off to a good start.<br>
              4th of July- I wasnt really patriotic at home, but when you get
        outside the country and realize how awesome our country is, it makes
        you more patriotic. I woke up to Elder Watts (ZL from Alamos my last
        zone) singing the "I´m proud to be an american" song. Then I had a
        special focus in personal study for the last few minutes. I studied
        great scriptures like 1 Ne 13 and stuff that talks about the country.
        Then we went to the zone conference. For the musical number, all the
        North Americans got up and we sang the national anthem. The rest of
        the day I spent working and listening to MoTab patriotic music. The
        best part was at night though. There is this guy, Timothy Kennedy,
        that lives in our ward. He is from Oklahoma, but met a Bolivian there
        and they came here to live. He is very american to say the least. He
        invited the 4 secretaries and the 2 hermanas from our ward to eat
        dinner at his house. We ate hot dogs, mac and cheese, mountain dew,
        and funnel cake. It was awesome. I miss mac and cheese. We then went
        outside to take pictures with the USA flag. We have some good ones
        with me and Elder Christensen. I love being american. Even though it
        is a very unrighteous country at times, it is still way better than
        the other ones.<br>
              The Hansens- I got home the night of the zone conference and
        just felt so happy to have the Hansens. It is just a really strong
        love for them. They are great people and really like us. Here is what
        President Hansen wrote me this week "Thank you for your extremely
        important work as financial secretary, which is vital to the mission.
        I am so grateful that Pres. Dyer put in place an elder I can trust for
        this sacred responsibility I have of overseeing the use of consecrated
        funds to run this mission and help the elders get by. Sister Hansen
        and I feel very blessed to be here". He calls me the CFO of the
        mission, and I like that. They are going to be great here and are
        definitely the people for the job.<br>
             Working in the Field- We started to go work harder in the field
        this week. It was full of a few things this week. 1) People that are
        busy and dont have time 2) Old women that really are not fond of us.
        3) Good nice people that are willing to listen but dont live in our
        area. We kinda got depressed cause we couldnt really get anything
        going. This is a super rich area, so people are very closed. We
        resplit/unsplit the area with the hermanas, and we have a lot of
        members, but no investigators. We are going to try hard though, and
        the Lord will help us out.<br>
             P-day- We started out going to the airport to help the Hansens
        and the APs with their flights to Sucre. After that we went to go play
        beach volleyball. It was really fun. It is harder than regular because
        it is hard to jump. I found sand everywhere when we left. Even though
        we didnt have the best team, we did really well and beat most of the
        better teams. It was really fun. After that we went to go play
        basketball. We had a good group of mostly gringos (and Elder Calderon,
        but he is half cause he studied at BYU). There are some good players.
        There is a kid named Elder Jacobson that is Mckay Jacobson from BYU´s
        little brother. He played a year at Texas Tech before coming. Also we
        have Elder Richard G Scott´s grandson. He likes keeping it a secret,
        so I wont tell you his name, but he is like 6´6 and can dunk. It was
        really fun, until the last 2 minutes when I pulled up to shoot a 3 and
        I came down on top of Elder Christensen´s foot and rolled my ankle. It
        is nothing serious, but it does hurt and I am trying to not walk on
        it. But, it isnt serious, so dont worry.<br>
        So that was my week. It felt kinda long for me. Time has really gone
        fast in the office though, and before I know it I will be leaving. I
        love you guys so much and I hope you enjoy Moon Lake. Say hi to
        everyone for me. Love you<br>
        Elder Bagley</small></p>

                        <p>Today was pretty boring. We did well in the morning. We woke up, exercised, studied, and all that. We had to take some beds to the district meeting, but we didn't have any way to keep them secure, so we just tied blankets to them. It looked pretty cool. District meeting was good, but it seemed like Christensen was annoyed today. He's been on a small power trip lately, which has bugged me. He just thinks his job is the most important. After the district meeting and lunch, I had my ZL meetings. There was a point where I stayed in my seat for like 3hrs. It was awful. It was just that all day. The USA lost to Belgium, so that sucks. I sprayed Weekes in the face with an air freshner because he wouldn't leave my desk. I also put my face on a $100 bill, it looks awesome. That is basically it. I'm pretty sure I'm the favorite missionary at the pension (not to brag). They love me and they are awesome. Anyways, weird that it is July. 11 more months.</p>

                        <h3>July 2, 2014</h3>
                        <p>Today was kinda stressful. We have 14 people (ZLs) in the house right now, so everything is crazy. I got up at went straight to the shower in order to be sure I got in. I got some studying in. I really liked Mormon 2 today. Prado was bugging me about studying on time, but when it came time to study, I was there, but he wasn't. After that we went to Nacho's house to pick up a receipt, but then he gave us cake too. We then went to the office and worked until about 12. Then we went to the leadership council meeting. We ate lunch there and I had a good time with my Peruvian friends, Nicho, Chonate, Apaza, Moreano, etc... I basically just said a lot of Peruvian words "Pe causa". I also got to talk to Elder Mickle a little. He is Elder Richard G. Scott's grandson, but not a lot of people know, so I just got to talk to him about that. Then Pres Hansen called me the CFO of the mission, which made me feel cool. I gave my presentation and nailed it. My giant E Bagley $100 bill was a good starter. After that, I ran some errands with PRado and then went to the office to find Frutillar's house owner. Apparently she hasn't received money for like 2yrs. Like 50% is with some members, but her sister has the other half, and the sister is a shady character and appears to have stolen money. We really aren't to blame for anything, but we are still part of it so it is stressful. So that was basically my day. I printed off some of the $100 bills. I'm definitely going to put them in some recuerdo notebooks. As I left the office, I got hit in the leg with a water ballon, so that put a damper on the night. Anyways, tomorrow should be better because all the ZLs go home.</p>

                        <p>Somtimes I'd like to write some great opening line for my journal, but I can't think of anything. We started out today with 14 people in our house. I like the ZLs, but that many people is just too much. There is always a huge line for the shower, we have to get people up, people are annoying, etc... They're gone now though, so it's a lot less crowded. After cleaning the house and studying, we went to the bank to take out money. Then we just went to the office and I counted like 26,000bs of stuff. After lunch, we just went back to work. I had to deal with the house owner of Frutillar again. We have it almost all solved now. We are going to make a new contract though. My buddy Elder Phillips is in Frutillar, so I have been talking with him during this whole process. He's super funny, and everytime I talk to him we say "see you on the lanes" because one time we were going to go bowling and we were talking smack, and it just stuck Calderon kinda freaked out today about buying breakfast for the zone conference. He doesn't like Weekes right now. At night we had our first "Noche de Hermanamiento". We played a game and gave a small spiritual thought. It was all about teamwork. 1 Cor 12:12-20. It turned out pretty well, better than expected. The rest of the night involved taking this fat little kid named Benjamin home and telling Calderon to suck up his pride. Wasn't a very interesting day, but not a bad one at least.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p><b>4th of July!!!!!</b> Today was a great day. I wasn't very patriotic back in Utah, but being in another country makes me realize how great mine is. We started off the day with a small zone conference. Before the conference, me, Weekes, Berrett, Harwood, Jarrell, Prescott, Turner and othe white guys just talked about the USA. The conference was great. I really just love the Hansens already. They are great people and they are going to do graet things. You can see that they love us as well. We also got to hear the final testimonies of Elder Jensen, Elder Jarrell, and Elder Merejildo (the latter 2 were my ZLs in Sucre). I'll miss those guys. For the special musical number, all the gringos got up and we sang the national anthem. It was awesome. After lunch I had to run all over the place for a few things. Then I got back to the office and worked. It was good because I got to talk to the Hansens for like 20min about a few things. They are great, and I think they really like me. I got to talk to Pres Hansen about the office. There's an idea running around the office about changing the companionships so I am with Christensen. There are pros and cons, so we'll see what happens. The best part of the day was dinner. We were invited by Tim Kennedy (white guy in our ward) to a 4th of July dinner. We ate hot dogs, mac and cheese, Mountain Dew, and little funnel cakes. I felt so American. We took pictures with an American flag after as well. Today was a great day. I'm proud to be an American, God bless the USA! 1 Ne 13 is an american chapter.</p>

                        <p>Boy am I tired. The morning was fine. We got up, studied, and did everything normally. Then we went to the office to finish up a few things. For lunch we went to this young couple's, Flia Carranza, house. They're pretty cool and the husband loves talking about his mission. After lunch we had to go back to the office. I can't even remember what we did, but we stayed for too long. As a secretary, the office is like a comfort zone. We really need to get out more, but it requries some effort. We finally left at like 6. From there, we went to knock doors. Knocking doors in a lot harder here. Everyone is super rich and most didn't want anything to do with us. We knocked a bunch of doors, but with no success. We went to this less active member's house, one that we visited a while ago. He's a member from a long time ago, and really likes talking about the past. Other than him, we just walked and talked with these 2 ladies that at least listened, and then the last door we knocked listened too. I don't like knocking doors. It's the only thing we've got right now though. On the way home, some drunk guy stopped us and made us cheer for Argentina. We got home and just crashed. I fell asleep for 30min before getting up and getting ready for bed. Overall, a pretty long day, and I'm dead tired, but at least we worked.</p>

                        <p>Just another Sunday. Today wasn't too eventful. Church was just regular. I'm almost at the point where I recognize everyone, so that's good. After church we went to eat lunch with the Flia Calderon. It's a cholita grandma, the daughter, and the granddaughter. They are nice and like missionaries. We were really full at the end though, so we couldn't finish. I fell asleep for like 5min too. After that we were ready to go work, but then Pres Hansen called me and I had to go do something for him that took like an hour. Finally we got to go work, but our appointment fell through. We ended up contacting the rest of the day. There were some people that weren't great, but a few were good. Most lived in other areas though, which is a bummer. The rest of the night was just normal. Quick day and I'm ready for P-day.</p>

                        <p>Well, I've got bad news, but I'll save it until the end. Today was pretty good. We started out by going to the airport. We went to help the Hansens with everything because it was their first flight. After that we went to rent the basketball place, and then to play beach volleyball. We played with our zone, and then with Sacaba too. It was really fun. Sand volleyball is harder because it is tough to jump in sand. We split into teams and even though my team wasn't that good, we beat every team we played. We were the underdogs, which is always fun. After volleyball we went to the office to write our families. My family is going to Moon Lake again. It's weird because I'll be there next year. After that we went to play basketball. It was me, Christensen, Jarrell, Watts, Racker, Calderon, Mickle, Potts, Thomson, Grigor, Jacobson, Phillips, Singer, and Stoddard. It was super fun. Everyone plays pretty well and it was competitive. Elder Mickle (Richard G Scott's grandson) is really good. He's like 6'6 and quick. I finally got the feeling back and knocked down some shots. All was good until my last play. I pulled up for a jump shot and Christensen came to block me. As I came down, I landed on his foot and rolled off the court cause I couldn't get up. Personally, it was a somewhat careless play on his part, but oh well. The rest of the day was spent resting my ankle and stuff. Kind of a poor ending to the day, but it should hopefully get better in a week or so. Oh well, these things happen. I just don't plan on telling the Hansen's yet because I'm scared they would ban sports. I'll just get a blessing and I'll be fine.</p>
