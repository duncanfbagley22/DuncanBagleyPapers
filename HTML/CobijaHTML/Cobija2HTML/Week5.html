            <h1>Week 5 <small>(June 23, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>One year older and a whole lot wiser too</h3>
            <p><small>Dearest family,<br>
                Well, this was the most exciting week in a long time. With the
            whole new people getting here, completing a year, a birthday, and
            preparing to send President Dyer home, it was really busy. I will
            explain what happened, and at the end I will attach my final letter to
            President Dyer. It is a good reflection on the last year here...
            <br><br>
            Monday- Went to lunch with Christensen, Harwood, and Johnston (guys
            from my group) and then had last minute office training
            <br><br>
            Tuesday- Dropped off Gallegos, and went to go pick up the new
            missionaries. In the morning there were only 2 new ones (from the
            states). Elder Preslar was the only new elder, and he stayed with us
            most the day. We went out to breakfast and all that. It is fun
            explaining the mission to new guys. At night we picked up the latinos
            (only 4). It is a pretty small group, but in August 19 missionaries
            are coming, so we will be a bit busier. At night we ate pizza with
            them and went home. It wasnt really a stressful day, but busy at
            least. Also, I got a random call from Churuquella where I got to talk
            to Hector. He hasnt been able to go to church because he has his
            University classes Sunday mornings, but he said he is reading and
            praying which is good.
            <br><br>
            Wednesday- Busy stressful long day. We went in the morning to the
            office to get some things finalized, and then went to the mission home
            to help Hna Dyer prepare for lunch. Then we went back to the office to
            get something for Pres Dyer and then back to the mission home for
            lunch. We ate enchiladas and brownies. We ate with all the new
            missionaries and their trainers and the Dyers. The secretaries and the
            assistants ate in another room though. I love eating at the mission
            home because Sonia is the pensionista (she lives in El Paso and lives
            at our old Pensionista, Benita´s house. It is like going back there
            everytime I eat there. I love eating with the assistants because they
            are Elder Weekes (friend from Sucre) and Elder Saad (he was my ZL in
            Cobija). The offices are so much fun. After that, we went to the
            offices and then had dinner in the offices with Elder Preslar and his
            trainer Elder Muñoz (Preslar is going to start his mission in
            Churuquella like me). I took a few pictures with Elder Christensen
            outside the temple to celebrate our first year.
            <br><br>
            Thursday- I hit a year!!! The time goes sooooooo fast. Seems like
            yesterday I got on a plane to Lima, and now I am halfway done.
            Thursday wasnt that exciting. I just had my ZL meetings and just that
            basically. I did get congratulations on completing a year from a lot
            of people though. Normally missionaries burn a shirt, but I need my
            shirts, so I didnt burn anything
            <br><br>
            Friday- Just nothing of importance there. I got a call from Muñoz at
            night to tell me that Claudia (I assume I wrote about her before) was
            getting baptized on Saturday and she said I had to be there...
            <br><br>
            Saturday- It started really bad. So as I stated in the last letter,
            Elder Prado lost our missionary welcome banner, so we have to make a
            new one. Problem is that me and Elder Christensen do everything in the
            office, so even though he lost it, he hasnt done anything to get the
            new one, so I spent Saturday morning and afternoon using a photoshop
            like program to make the flag and finding out where to print a giant
            flag in Cochabamba. I almost wanted to strangle Prado because he
            doesnt realize that we need this thing for next Friday and it is his
            responsability. Patience... At 5 we went to the chapel to help Elder
            Christensen and Elder Calderon organize the storage room. That is
            where we store all the mission materials. We have like 4500 Books of
            Mormon, 11000 pamphlets of the Restoration, and a bunch of other
            stuff. I included a picture of the stack of boxes that contain the
            BoMs. Then we had a ward activity. We played a game where people
            followed a rope (iron rod) and were tempted and asked questions along
            the way and were rewarded at the end according to how they did. It
            turned out a lot better than we expected and the ward loved it. Me and
            Elder Christensen left early to head out to the baptism. We contacted
            the taxi driver on the way, so that was cool too. I got to Jardin like
            3 minutes after she had entered to water, but I was still there to
            congratulate her and all that. It was really weird being in that
            chapel again. I got to see all my old friends from that ward, and when
            I got there everyone saw me and had a big smile on their faces and
            were happy to see me. It made me feel really good and realize that I
            had an impact on that ward.
            <br><br>
            Sunday- Well, first things first is that I turned 20. I am so old now.
            We just went to church like normal and in the gospel principles class
            the people sand happy birthday to me. For lunch we went to the bishops
            sisters house (this is the member who served in Quito who I ate lunch
            with when I came to Cocha like 8 months ago, novemberish). They sang
            me happy birthday as well. I ate like the best oranges I have ever
            tasted as well. After that we went to a less active members house and
            found out they were moving, so we helped them move. It was good too
            because it just so happens that they are moving too...Barrio Jardin,
            so I will just pass the reference over to all those guys. After that
            we visited the Flia Flores, that family I mentioned last week. They
            were nice enough to get me a special food for my birthday (humintas,
            some weird corn thing that tastes pretty good). They are super cool
            and I took a picture with them after. Finally, we went to the pension.
            We found out that the USA tied and basically got a play by play from
            the pensionista. Then, I sat down to eat my cake. Just as they were
            about to sing to happy birthday when Hna Rumualdo came and smash a
            plate of whipped cream in my face. We got me cleaned up and then they
            sang to me. I went down to bite the cake (tradition) and Elder
            Christensen smashed my head into the cake. So I had to get cleaned up
            again. It was really fun though and I enjoyed it all. I really enjoyed
            this birthday. Even though I started the day with no plans, we were
            able to do service, teach a lesson, and eat cake. It was a great
            birthday.
            <br><br>
            Monday- We just went and played soccer. It was fun, and I still am
            good enough. Our zone is super cool.
            <br><br>
            So ya, that was my week. I loved my birthday packages and all that. It
            gives me a little piece of home. I love you guys so much, and I will
            be writing to you next monday under the reign of Pres Hansen. Here is
            my email to President Dyer:
            <br><br>
            President Dyer,<br>
            This is very strange for me writing my last letter to you. It still
            seems to me that I havent been here that long. This last year has
            really flown by. First of all, I would just like to say thank you for
            everything. I know you said to write more about ourselves, but I cant
            write this letter without saying thank you first and foremost. In this
            last week, I have had a lot of time where I have been able to reflect
            on this last year. On Thursday I completed a year and Sunday was my
            20th birthday, so I reflected a lot on how much I have changed and the
            experiences I have had in the last year. I am a completely different
            person than I was a year ago. I used to be an example of a member that
            just went through the motions. I went to church and all, but didnt
            have a great testimony. That is the thing that I am most grateful for
            so far. I know that my Redeemer lives, I know that this is His church,
            and I know that He loves me. Those are the biggest changes. I am not
            perfect nor anywhere near it, but I am becoming the person that I want
            to be. I might not have dozens of baptisms, but I have converted the
            most important person, and that is me. I have been thinking about a
            scripture that I have learned in the last year that really describes
            what I have learned. One that comes to mind is 3 Ne 13: 31-33. I
            realize that this life is to prepare myself for the kingdom of God
            (Alma 34:32). I am not concerned with the material possessions or the
            way that I am perceived by others, but I just care what God thinks. I
            love this mission. This has been the most important year of my life,
            and I wouldnt change it for anything in the world. I love this gospel
            and I love my Savior. I know that the Book of Mormon is the word of
            God and he has spoken to me, counseled me, and comforted me through
            the pages of that book during this year. Thank you for all of the
            teachings, interviews, and your example during this last year. You as
            well as Hna Dyer are like parents for us in the mission, and have had
            an impact that I will never forget. I love you both and will miss you
            both. Que el Señor les bendiga y su familia por el trabajo que han
            hecho en Bolivia. Gracias por todo.
            <br><br>
            Con amor,
            Elder Bagley
            <br><br><br>
            
            At that is how I will end my letter...<br>
            Con amor,<br>
            Elder Bagley</small></p>

                        <p>First day as 1st string secretary.It was quite a full day too. We got to the airport around 8 to welcome the new missionaries. E' Prado lost the Welcome Banner, so that sucks. Really sucks. Picking up the new missionaries is always fun. There were only 2 new north americans, so it wasn't as difficult as last time. We took the elder with us for the rest of the day because there weren't any more elders. So we went to breakfast and then just hung out in the office. His name is Elder Preslar. He seems like he'll be a good missionary. We went out to lunch with him, the other secretaries, and Elder Muñoz (different than my old comp). Muñoz is a talker, so was just talking the whole time about how he was supposed to be assistant and stuff like that. Most of the elders from Ecuador like to talk. Later in the night, we went and picked up the latinos at the airport. There were only 4, so this is one of the smaller groups I've seen. We took them to the temple hotel where they'll be staying. We had to wait for Elder Calderon and Christensen to bring dinner to us, so I just sat there listening to Muñoz talk again. When the food finally got there we just ate the pizza and left. All in all, a pretty busy day, but a good one for my first day as secretary all by myself.</p>

                        <p>Well, today was even busier than yesterday. In the morning, I went with Christensen to the office to do some things, and then we went to the mission home to help the Dyers. Then we went back to the office to get some books, and then we went to the mission home again. There we ate lunch. We had enchiladas or something and it was really good. We ate together, the secretaries and assistants, and it was fun. Then we went down to the mission hotel place to the training meeting. It was my first time giving the presentation, and I guess it went well enough. After that we just went back to the office to work. At night, we just ate dinner in the office. Maybe from everything I've written down, today doesn't seem too busy, but by the end of the day I had been all over the city and I was beat. By 12 I was tired, and at night I died. Oh well, tomorrow is the big day...</p>

                        <p>ONE YEAR!!!!! Wow, I just finished a year in the mission. It's pretty crazy. One year ago today I was leaving my house. I've changed so much in this year. Definitely the most important and influential year of my life. That being said, today was boring. We woke up and I went to the bank, but it was closed. Apparently today is Corpus Christi, some holiday I've never heard of. Everything was closed. So I went back to the office and just worked like normal. At lunch, we ate with the 2 new sisters in the pension. Hna Capito is a brand new hermana and she is Rumualdo's comp. She is good enough. Hna Llanos is Hna Hansen's new comp, and she just gives off a vibe of thinking we are dumb. It is the first day, so it could change. After lunch we went to the office and I did my financieros with the ZLs. I like basically all the ZLs in Cocha, so it is always fun. At night we had a preparation meeting for an activity we are going to have on Saturday. All in all, boring day, but I have 1 year now, and that is still crazy for me. They say it goes really fast after the year mark, so we will just wait and see.</p>

                        <p>Today was really really full of nothing, until like 5 minutes ago. We had district meeting this morning. Me and Calderon got there late because we had to go to the bank and do a few other things. Christensen is our new DL and he is a lot more entertaining than Vasquez. It's about time he's DL. We had a small zone meeting after, where we get up and presented ourselves, like everyone has done it since the beginning of time. The goal is to always be the funniest, and I nailed it today. I felt like a comedian. My best parts were when I said I was from the land of Deseret, and when I said, as an answer to "what don't you like", I said when they don't paint all the sides of the house, when cars run red lights and almost kill you, and when dogs wear little sweaters. You definitely had to be there, but it was great. After lunch, I went to the office, and we did office stuff until 8. After dinner I got home and just felt different. Not sure why, but like I was missing something. I definitely need to be a little more spiritual. That's what I think is off. Best part of the night was when Muñoz called me. He told me that Claudia is getting baptized tomorrow. I'm going to count her as my convert, because I was there to find her, teach her, bring her to church, and invite her to be baptized. The fact that she is getting baptized makes me really happy. I get to go tomorrow too, so that'll be fun. Anyways, good way to end the night.</p>

                        <p>Today I was mad, stressed, happy, bored, and tired, all wrapped up in one day. We started out the day by organizing all the closets and desks we have here at the house. All the extra that we have. After that we went to the office. This is where I got mad. We lost/"Prado lost" the welcome banner, so we need to make another. The problem is that Prado and Calderon aren't doing anything, and it bugs me that me and Christensen do everything, even when it's not our job. So ya, that is the mad portion. After lunch, we went back to the office. There I started to recreate the image for the banner. This is where I got frustrated. It just wouldn't work. Finally I just downloaded a new program and it worked after like 2 hours. I was also really tired, and I almost fell asleep at the computer. Then we went to the chapel. We helped Calderon organize the storage room for the mission teaching materials. We have like 4500 Books of Mormon, 3400 agendas, 11,200 pamphets of the restoration. It's a room full. While doing that, we were waiting for our activity to start. But... our WML showed up super late, so I was bored while waiting. It was the "tree of life" where we did a mock tree of life game with an iron rod, temptations, and all that. At the beginning it looked like it would be a disaster, but it turned out decent enough. Then, I got to go to a baptism. Muñoz called yesterday and said that I was invited to Claudia's baptism. So, me and Christensen went out to km 9.5 to the baptism. It was great to see all my friends from Jardin. Flia Cahvez, Dennis, Hna Cadima, and I think Claudia was glad I went. Seeing all the people made me feel really good because they still remember me and I know I must've done something right in that ward. So that was my day full of emotions, but it ended on a high note at least.</p>

                        <p>Well, first of all, today is my birthday!!! Wow, I'm 20. That is weird. Well, this is what happened on my 1st and only Bolivian birthday. We started out normal and went to church and stuff. It was good. This random girl named Silvia came, I'm not sure who she is, but some guy asked us to sit by her, so it was something. We had gospel principles where they sang happy birthday to me, so that's cool. After church we ate lunch with the bishop's sister, Hna Quiroz. She's really nice, but really likes to talk. She served in Ecuador and really likes missionaries. After that we went with her to visit a less active, who just happened to be moving, so me and Prado helped move boxes, closets, desks, beds, and other things for her. It was good to do service, it made me feel useful. After that we went to visit the Flia Flores. A husband and his nonmember wife. They are really cool and even got me special food for my birthday. We ate humintas, a weird corn thing that is actually pretty good. We had a short lesson afterwards as well. Finally, we got to the pension. They made me a cake!!! Right after I blew out the candle, Hna Rumualdo smashed a plate of whipped cream in my face. Freaking peruana... After I got cleaned up, I went to bite the cake (it's a tradition) and Christensen smashed my head in the cake. I had cake all over. It was a great way to end the day, and definitely a birthday that I won't forget. I'm 20 now, so no longer a teenager. I'm old now...</p>

                        <p>My first day being 20. I don't feel 20 yet. Anyways, today was P-day. We got up and went to internet. Well first, we cleaned the house, and then we went to do internet. I got a few birthday wishes and I got to open my birthday packages. They sent me so much stuff. Not that that shows how much they love me, but I know that they love me a lot. I got stuff from my parents as well as from Kyle and Edie, my aunt and uncle. After we did all that we went to the stake center to play soccer and eat with the zone. The guy that drove us there was a member and when we got there he shouted at Laidlaw and ran up and hugged him. Apparently, the guy's wife was Laidlaw's pensionista. Anyways, soccer was pretty fun and our zone is still pretty cool. After that we just went back to the office to finish up a few things. At night we had an FHE with Hna Nacho and his family. He is the guy that supplies everything for the mission. It was a nice FHE, and we ate hot dogs after. The family is cool and we have a great relationship with them. Tomorrow, I'm going to be super busy, so we'll see how it goes.</p>
