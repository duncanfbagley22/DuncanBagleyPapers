            <h1>Week 4 <small>(June 17, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Los Mundials/Fathers Day</h3>
            <p><small>Family,<br>
                I am continuing the streak of writing very late on p day, and I
             assume you are somewhat used to it by now. Pdays only kind of exist
             for us. There is always some kind of emergency somewhere and I have to
             respond always. Even though everyone here is a missionary, people
             still act like kids sometimes. I really am trying hard to think of
             what to write for this week, but there isnt that much that went on.
             One thing that I can say is HAPPY FATHERS DAY DAD!!!!!!! Hope it is
             the best fathers day ever, but next year will be better because I will
             be home. I will just talk about all of the things that I remember and
             I will try to explain a little bit about what exactly it is that I do
             here.<br>
                    Flia ???- Well, we actually have a semi investigator that I
             know and have taught and I know where they live. I am not sure what
             their last name is, but I think it is Flores. Here is the story. The
             dad is a member from a long time ago. He went inactive (like the rest
             of South America). He was off and on for a while. He married Noelia
             (at least I remember one name), but she is a Christian or something
             like that. They had a son, named Diego, and he was perfectly fine.
             Then, after about 6 years, that had another son, named Mateo. He was
             fine for a bit, but then he started having a lot of health problems.
             Like he was in the hospital forever and had surgeries and stuff. They
             said that their hopes werent very high for him. This is when the dad
             started getting reactivated. He had the bishop come give the baby
             blessings and stuff like that and the dad started going to church.
             Then...the baby got better.The dad, seeing that the Lord helped him,
             decided he needed to go back to church. The mom, not being active in
             another church, started going with him. She started out slowly, but
             now goes pretty consistently. She said she needs the presence of a
             church in her life. Problem is that she isnt baptized. She sees the
             example of members that go inactive and is worried about making the
             commitment. The missionaries have visited her for like a year, but
             nothing has happened... yet. I just think the fact that the
             missionaries in the offices havent been the best missionaries
             recently. Also, there hasnt been a lot of follow up. For now, this is
             my point of attack. She is perfect member material, she just needs a
             little push. We had lunch and a lesson with them this week, so we have
             gotten started.<br>
                   World Cup- Uhhhhhhhhhhhh, it is so hard to not watch. I
             basically see all of the scores, but it is hard not to watch. On the
             big street here, they put out some giant TV for people to watch and
             everyone has it on in their houses. Sometimes I can here it in the
             office next to ours. Sacrifices bring blessings I guess.<br>
                    Fridays- One of the days this week, me, Elder Gallegos, Elder
             Christensen, Elder Calderon (new secretary of tramites), Elder Weekes
             and Elder Mero (the APs), went to Fridays for a goodbye dinner for
             elder Gallegos and Elder Mero, who are leaving this cambio. It was
             fun. I get along well with all of those guys. The NBA finals
             highlights were on, but I didnt watch. Me, Weekes, and Christensen
             were basically hiding under the table in order to not see. Going to
             Fridays is like taking a step into America for a second.<br>
                  Cambios- There were cambios this week. It is weird being
             secretary, because I knew the cambios on Wednesday, when usually I
             found out on Sunday. I feel special sometimes<br>
                  Prado and Calderon- This is the hardest challenge in the office
             so far. After a rough start with Gallegos, we get along pretty well
             now. Even though he is 28, he is cool and really smart. He understands
             things that most missionaries dont, and I enjoy the intelligent
             conversation with him. Prado on the other hand, is a child. We say he
             is kinda like a deacons quorum president, because he has his Aaronic
             Priesthood duty thing memorized and has good manners and stuff, but he
             acts like he is 12. He isnt hard to get along with, but he is hard to
             work with. He constantly forgets his phone and other things, doesnt
             really have any drive to work, and he lost this expensive banner for
             when the new missionaries arrive (not sure how he lost it...). Like,
             he isnt disobedient or anything, but I feel like I am baby sitting
             sometimes. Calderon is the new secretary of material and tramites and
             packages and whatnot. He went to BYU for a year, so his english is
             good. We actually get along really well, but he is letting the power
             of being in the office get to his head. Pride cycle. The worst problem
             is when the two of them are together. On Sunday, they didnt go to
             church (apparently they were sick...) but they still looked fine and
             were doing a bunch of other things. Itll be interesting when we have
             to start working just us 4.<br>
             So that is what I can remember from this week. Now here is a rundown
             of what I do in the offices:<br>
             Missionaries- I have to do the finances for the reimbursements of the
             missionaries. Anytime they take taxis to do tramites, they need
             medicine, they buy reimbursable things, etc, I reimburse them. It is a
             lot more complicated than it sounds, but it isnt too bad. The hard
             part is when they are things they really shouldnt reimburse or when
             they need reimbursements but I havent met with the zone leaders so
             they dont have their money. It is the bulk my job, but it isnt that
             hard<br>
             President and Hna Dyer´s finances- It is reimbursing them basically.
             We have some Bank of America program that I do it in. The goal is to
             make it so that the church doesnt owe them money and they dont owe the
             church money before they go. This is probably something dad
             understands as far as financing, just a little more primative because
             I am in Bolivia<br>
             Mission Expenses- I pay for everything, from houses to food to office
             supplies to everything like that. I feel like sometimes if I dont do
             my job well the mission will crumble, no pressure<br>
             So that is the general general general of my job. I feel like it is
             preparing me well to work in real life. I am now the big guy on
             campus, as Elder Gallegos went to another area. Hopefully I can do
             this well. Itll definitely be the easiest financing ever, cause I have
             the spirit stronger as a missionary, so that helps. Anyways, love you
             guys so much and I will talk to you next week, on Monday hopefully.<br>
                Hasta lunes, que ya tendré un año y 20 años<br>

                        <p>Today was quite uneventful. We got up and studied and went to the zone meeting. It was a good meeting, and I still really like our zone. Laidlaw and Saad are great zone leaders. After the zone meeting, we went to go eat lunch with is family in the ward. They are great and really love the missionaries. They are one of the families I think I can start building a close relationship with. Hopefully, we get there. After lunch we went to the office and I did my financieros with the ZLs. I do everything on my own now. It'll still be scary once E' Gallegos leaves though. That was the basics of today. Hopefully, the best of the week is a little more eventful.</p>

                        <p>Well... today wasn't very eventful either. Just basic work all day long. I have a feeling that at the end of my time in the office I will be either so tired of the office, or it'll be like home. Today only involved one important event. Elder Gallegos decided he wanted to go out to eat to have one last hurrah as secretary. So me, Gallegos, Christensen, Calderon, Weekes, and Mero went to Friday's. Every time I go there it is a litte step into the United States for a second. Then I go back outside and realize that I am still in Bolivia. I had a cheesy bacon cheeseburger. The NBA finals highlights were on, but I did my best and saw exactly 0% of the highlights. Mission is more important right now. I enjoyed the time with all the other guys, and as much as he bugs me sometimes, I will miss Gallegos. Another boring in the books for Elder Bagley.</p>

                        <p>Today was very interesting. Today there were 2 important events. The first one was that the World Cup started today. It really isn't fair being a missionary while the World Cup goes on. Out on the "Prado" (the major street here) they set up a giant TV screen so everyone can watch. There's people outside selling popcorn and all that. The next time I'll be able to watch a world cup, I'll be 24. Dang it. Ya, so that was the first thing. Second was that we found out the cambios. Gallegos isn't happy at all with his cambio. He wanted to go to Sucre or have a northamerican companion, but he is going to be with a Peruvian in Cochabamba. That basically ruined his day, plain and simple. There are some weird looking cambios, but I trust President Dyer. As I write this, I'd like to apologize for all the boring days that are included in this journal. I'll try to be more exciting.</p>

                        <p>Today started out really boring like all the other days, but it ended well. We were at the offices all day, but I had nothing to do. Gallegos had to finish up doing all of his stuff, so that left me with nothing to do. I sat at a computer with nothing available to me. As a missionary, the internet is pretty boring. I just watched like every "I'm a mormon" video I could find. I am glad I'm obedient though, keeps my conscience clean. After that awful ordeal of doing nothing, we actually taught a lesson. Woohoo! That family we had lunch with a few days ago is actually a part member family. I didn't know that. The wife isn't a member, and the husband just became active again. Their 1yr old son got sick a while ago, and that got them going to church. This is a baptism waiting to happen. Not sure why it hasn't happened yet, but I'll figure it out. Gallegos taught really well. Usually he is like a robot, but today he was good. There's a small spark of progress here, so we'll be focusing on it for now.</p>

                        <p>Last day of training. It is pretty crazy how fast these 4 weeks have gone. After today (plus Sunday and Monday which don't count) I will be on my own. All we did today was stay in the office and review some last minute things before I do it all on my own. There really isn't anything interesting to say about today though. One thing is that I really like my pensionista. Hna Bety from Beni. She is just super cool but funny as well. She and I get along really well. It's her, her husband, her disabled son, and he 20ish yr old daughter. They are all super cool, and I think I am slowly becoming the favorite (not to be prideful or anything). I've had the best of luck with pensionistas, Hna Vicky, Benita, and now Bety. Looks like food will never be a problem in the mission.</p>

                        <p>Last Sunday of the cambio. Fastest cambio ever, no really just 4 weeks. It is crazy that it is over though. We got to church and who did we see... Elder Cruz. He is going home tomorrow, so he was saying goodbye. I took a picture with him. I'll really miss him. We had the gospel principles class, and someone bought cake for us. After church, we ate lunch with the nice old lady that is somewhat crazy. We ate lots of potatoes. She just didn't want us to stop eating, ever. After that we went home and... accidently fell asleep. Anyways, after that we went to a priesthood stake conference, but like 5 minutes in we left to go free someone from the hospital. We got back, listen for a bit, then left to an appointment. It was just me and Gallegos today, because Elder Prado and Elder Calderon were "sick" (not really that sick though) so they stayed home. We ate dinner with Hna Lucinda and her family. They are cool recent converts. We had a good time, even with Hna Hansen and Hna Francia. Usually they hate us, so today was a good change. It was actually a productivish day, so I can't complain too much.</p>

                        <h3>June 16, 2014</h3>
                        <p>Today was an eventful yet uneventful day. It was the last day for Elder Gallegos here in Cobija, and after 10 months, you'd think he would want to go visit a bunch of people. Instead, he just wanted to visit with his computer. We really didn't do anything exciting, except that we went to Friday's. Elder Johnston invited us to go because we finish a year on Thursday. So me, Christensen, Prado, Gallegos, E' Johnston, E' Harwood, and both of their companions went to eat. It was really good, and Elder Johnston paid for all of it, really nice guy. It was good to reminisce with Christensen, Johnston, and Harwood about the MTC and just the mission. Other than that, we just stayed at the office. We went to dinner and enjoyed our last time their with the whole crew. I will miss all of these guys here. Anyways, going out to lunch was the big moment of the day, but the rest was uneventful.</p>
