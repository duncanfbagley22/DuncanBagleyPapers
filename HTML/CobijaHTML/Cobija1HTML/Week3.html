            <h1>Week 3 <small>(June 9, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Whoa, I´m halfway there</h3>
            <p><small>FAMILIA,<br>
                Well, first off, dont think that I am tronki because of the title.
             I just figured it out this week while talking to Elder Christensen,
             aka Jerry, about how much time we have. As of Wednesday, I will be
             halfway done. Crazy right? I still feel like a new missionary, and now
             I am starting to be on the older side of the mission. Plus, everyone
             says that the second year goes by really fast, so if that is true, I
             will be home in like a month. I dont have as much to say this week,
             because you already know what happened on Monday, Tuesday, and
             Wednesday, but I will try to make it all seem interesting.
             <br><br>
             Thursday- The first day of the audit. Now, the audit wasnt quite as
             difficult as we thought it would be. We, and by we I mean Elder
             Gallegos, have done the job very well. It was the old secretaries that
             caused all of the problems. For example, every week, most of the zone
             leaders come in for a meeting. In that meeting, they give us all of
             their receipts and stuff from the week and we reimburse them. We take
             the info, put it in the system, then put all the receipts in an
             envelope and store it all filed by date. We have boxes and everything
             is organized. The old secretaries, not so much. We found receipts,
             along with a lost passport, in a closet in the house the other day.
             Terrible organization. The audit guy was nice though, and helped us
             learn a lot. The next audit should be next June or July, so I will be
             safe. Not much else happened on thursday
             <br><br>
             Friday- Just more audit stuff and all that. Kinda boring. I really
             dont remember much else of what happened on Friday, but I remember we
             just talked to President Dyer and the audit guy and just that. Not too
             exciting.
             <br><br>
             Saturday- Personally, my favorite day of the week so far. We started
             out in the morning with the Kiosk thing I think I have explained
             before. We did it with Elder Edmonds (from my district in Jardin, went
             to Brighton, good buddy on the mission). We got a few contacts and it
             turned out good enough. We had lunch with a less active member, then
             we went to the office. This was my moment of the week. The other day,
             we got into a taxi and I saw a wallet on the seat. I picked it up,
             looked inside, and found $100 US dollars, 15bs, and an ID card. Well,
             I took it with me, trusting myself more than a sketchy bolivian taxi
             driver, and put it in my bag. I forgot about it, until Saturday. On
             Saturday, we started looking the owner of the card up on the internet.
             She just happened to be a fairly good artist (actually her art is
             weird) and she has her own webpage. I called her up and explained what
             had happened. She lives in Santa Cruz and Pittsburgh, and speaks
             english very very well. She was very greatful, and I told her I would
             send her an email explaining our address and everything. I took
             advantage of the opportunity and sent her the following email:
             <br><br>
             Dear Ms. Requena,
             <br><br>
                             My name is Elder Bagley the person that you spoke with
             on the phone and I am a missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ of
             Latter-Day Saints here in Cochabamba, Bolivia. We have here your ID
             card, your wallet, $100, and 15bs. The address of our office here in
             Cochabamba is, as it says below, Avenida Villarroel N°1132, Edificio
             Confort, 7mo piso, Oficina C. We are here Tuesday through Friday from
             10:30am-1pm and then 2pm-6:30pm. Our office phone is (591) 4-411-7207
             and our cell phone number in 71862919. I don’t know what will be
             easier for you so that we can get your wallet back to you; we can have
             your cousin come here to pick it up, or we can go drop it off wherever
             they live, either one is perfect for us. Just let us know so we can
             get back to you as soon as possible. We would also like to use this
             opportunity to invite you to learn more about our message. This video
             (hyperlinked to the Because of Him video) explains a little bit about
             what we believe in, and why it is important. You can also visit the
             webpage http://www.mormon.org for more information. We know that this
             message can help you in every aspect of your life. Thank you and let
             us know if you need anything else.
             <br><br><br><br>
             
             
             Sincerely,
             <br><br><br><br>

             Even though I am an office missionary, I still get opportunities at
             times. She has responded back, offering to donate money to the church,
             but obviously I said no and just told her to watch the video. I also
             have shown it all to Hna Dyer, and she loves it. #browniepoints. I
             really have faith this opportunity was part of God´s plan. Being a
             missionary is cool.
             <br><br>
             Sunday- pretty normal. Went to church and then taught a few lessons
             afterwards. Me, Elder Christensen, and Elder Edmonds went home at
             night and just talked about high school. Fun to remember the good ole
             days
             <br><br>
             Monday- We found a dart board and darts in our house, so we have been
             having tournaments and stuff between all of us. This morning we made a
             bet that the winner could hit the loser in the butt with a plastic bat
             we have. Well, I lost twice, so Edmonds hit me. The video should be in
             dropbox.  We went to the office later in the morning, but all the
             computers were being used, so I took a nap. President and Hermana Dyer
             gave us lunch, so that was cool. Then, we went and played paintball
             with the zone. It was fun. Cool part was I was with Elder Thomson and
             Elder Emerson. Elder Lopez was the trainer of all 3 of us, so
             technically we are all brothers. Paintball was fun, but I got hit in
             the ribs so there is a mark there. I captured the flag once, so I
             contributed this time.
             <br><br>
             So that was my week. This next week will be my last week of training
             here, then it is all up to me. Love you guys so much, and I will talk
             to you next week. Chau

                        <p>Back to work with the audit things. From 8-1 we were there doing all that stuff. Putting receipts in envelopes, changing envelope sizes, and just a cornacopia of paper related activities. At 2 we had all of the zone leader meetings. These ones were worse because all the people have been complaining about not having money (they almost always have money, but they don't take it out. There were so many problems to fix. It was getting a bit stressful to say the least. Luckily, I get along pretty well with almost if not all the zone leaders, so that makes it a little bit better. Other than that, we just went back to organizing the papers. After this week, I never want to see another brown envelope again. I even got a paper cut today opening up some envelopes. I think knocking doors was a lot better than this...</p>

                        <p>Well, audits are really boring. The audit guy got to the office at about 8. We started early. He is a pretty cool guy. He came from the offices in Santa Cruz. The audit wasn't actually that bad. I just realized that I got my days confused. The audit was on the fifth, but I'll talk about that a little later. On the forth, not much happened. I woke up and we went to go play basketball with a few of the people that stayed at the house. Me, Christensen, Calderon, Crankshaw, Atwood, and Thomson. It was actually really fun. I had a good face off with Thomson, who's my little brother in the mission. He would hit 3's and I would come back with little hook shots in the post. It was really cold in the morning though. In the afternoon we had a leadership counsel. We only stayed for a little bit, just enough for us secretaries to give small presentations. It was funny because during Christensen's, Gallegos had changed the title slide so that the picture was Jerry from Tom & Jerry. Everyone died laughing. After that, I just worked and finally wrote to my family. Writing isn't a huge, gigantic, important thing like it was when I started, but when I almost didn't get to do it, I kinda freaked out. So ya, that's was happened on Wednesday.</p>

                        <p>Thursday was the audit, like I said. It wasn't as hard as I thought. We actually do a pretty good job. It was the other secretaries from a year ago that screwed everything up. Our job was just fixing all of their mistakes. We spent most of the day doing that. The audit gives me a good opportunity to see the organization of the church. You can see how it is the Lord's church, because it is organized perfectly. It would probably be one of the best companies in the world, but it is a nonprofit church. It might sound weird, but this opportunity strengthens my testimony because the financial stability and economic genious that is the church is incredible. No way a fiction book by a farm boy could start something like this.</p>

                        <p>Well, just kinda boring today. We started out with the audit again. Same guy, same place, same stuff. We just talked about the money stuff again. One interesting thing that happened was when we went home to find receipts. We were looking in our house in a desperate attempt to find receipts. We ended up finding the receipts and even Elder Van Horn's passport that had been "lost" for almost a year. Great organization Elder Van Horn! The only other important thing is we had a general meeting with the audit guy and Pres Dyer. Made me fell important being with them. After that, the audit ended and we passed. Glad that the audit is over, and by the next one I'll be at my house. Pretty boring day, but it's over now.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>Well, today was my favorite day of the week. In the morning, we had the kiosk. So me, Prado, Gallegos, and Edmonds (he's been with us this week because he's had tramites) went to do it. It's fun to do it with Edmonds because he has a lot of excitement for missionary work (not sure that makes sense in english). We found a few good people. We went to lunch at a active/semiactive/inactive lady's house. She seems great, but for some reason she doesn't go to church. After that I went to the office to do some things. There, I remembered something very important. A few days ago, as I got into a taxi, I found a wallet. Looking through the wallet I found $100 US Dollars and a Bolivian ID. Saturday afternoon was spent on the internet trying to find her. After a little bit of time, we discovered that she is a pretty good artist, so she has her own website. Her name is Natalia Gonzalez Requena (her art is pretty weird actually). So I called the number to try to get in contact. Turns out, she lives in Santa Cruz, but also lives in Pittsburgh, PA. She speaks like perfect english. She seemed very grateful and relieved. I sent her an email after to give her our address and phone number. I also used it as an opportunity to share the gospel. I invited her to watch the "Because of Him" video and visit mormon.org. Who knows how it'll turn out, but at least I planted a seed. It is cool to still be able to preach the gospel even though I'm at a computer all day. We'll see how the story unfolds, but I'm hoping something good will come from this.</p>

                        <p>Sundays are the longest days for me in my current position. Days that I go to the office go really fast. Sundays just take forever. Cobija as a ward is kinda boring. It's all old people and just isn't very lively. There're some good people I guess, but overall it is boring. I think I have fallen asleep every sunday so far. After church we ate lunch with this family of long time members. The one good thing that comes by having lots of old people is that all of the people have cool conversion stories. They all have stories you read about in the Liahona. After eating lunch with that family, we actually had a fairly productive day. We taught something like 5 lessons, which is good for us. The thing with be a secretary is we don't follow up much, so we're gonna have to work on that more. At night we had a dart tournament between everyone in the house. We found a random dart board in the house, so we've been putting it to good use. It was a lot more fun than I thought too. Overall, a pretty good day. Good enough for a Sunday.</p>

                        <p>P-day is the best day. It is something that needs to exist, because without it I think I would die. Today was got up and... played more darts. Me, Christensen, and Edmonds played various types of dart related games. The last one ended with the winner smacking the loser with a plastic bat. I lost twice. We got videos of Edmonds hitting me. After that we went to the office, but there weren't enough computers, so I just took a nap on the couch. Our lunch was some salteñas Hna Dyer gave us. Then, we went and played paintball with the zone. It was really fun. I did better this time. I died twice, but I captured the flag once. We played with our whole zone, Edmonds, Thomson, and Nazareno. We also met up with the Sacaba zone, which includes E' Emerson, so me, THomson, and Emerson took a picture together because we are brothers (E' Lopez trained us 3). Finally, to end the day I wrote my family. Everything is going well at home, Griffin graduated high school, so we're all grown up now. Not much else to comment about today, but it was a good day nonetheless.</p>
