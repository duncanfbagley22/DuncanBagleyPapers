            <h1>Week 1 <small>(May 26, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Assistant to the Regional Financial Secretary</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
                This was quite the interesting week. Probably has been this biggest
              change since I got to Sucre. I will just explain the things that
              happened each day, just so you can see that the life is a little
              different than it was before. I put the title as "assistant" to the
              regional financial secretary because that is what I have been this
              week. The old guys is training me, but this week was just following
              him. My companions for right now are Elder Gallegos from Argentina (he
              is training me) and Elder Prado from Ecuador (he is secretary of
              registros, meaning he does referrels and baptism records). Elder
              Gallegos is...wait for it... 28 years old. Weird right, he is the
              oldest missionary in the mission. At times he is difficult to get
              along with, because it is weird for an almost 20 year old to tell a 28
              year old what to do. He does his job very well, so that is good. As
              for Elder Prado, he is a prototypical mormon. He has his Duty to God
              plaque up in the house, he has a brother named Nefi, and all that
              stuff. My 2 comps are literally polar opposite from each other.
              Gallegos acts really old, and Prado really young. I do both, to try to
              make things work out. I live with Elder Christensen (he is the
              Presidential Secretary, also my MTC companion) and Elder Vasquez (he
              is from Peru). I get along with everyone, except for Gallegos. It isnt
              that we fight, it is just that he does things that I dont agree with,
              but I dont really say anything about it cause he´ll get mad. For a
              reason missionaries dont come in all ages. Anyways, I dont wanna
              complain. Gallegos is nice most the time, and speaks english, so I
              dont speak as much spanish as I want to. This is what happened in the
              week...<Br>
              Monday- I said goodbye to El Paso. Benito asked us if he can serve a
              mission, and that is the best thing you can hear from a convert. It is
              hard leaving that area, but it is in good hands with Muñoz.<br><br>
              
              Tuesday- I got to Cobija (that is my wards name) at 7 30. We went to
              the airport to pick up all the new arrivals. It is cool doing that.
              The best part of the job. They are all excited for the mission and
              just ask a bunch of questions and it makes me feel important cause I
              can answer all their questions about the mission and Bolivia. It is
              also fun to do it with Elder Christensen, gives us a flashback to July
              when we came. After that we did some financialy things and then at
              night we picked up more missionaries (this time the latinos). It is
              almost just as fun to pick them up. We had to take the newbies to the
              hotel and at night we ate burritos with them (burritos are good for a
              starving missionary). That was tuesday<br><br>
              
              Wednesday- We went to the training meeting for the new missionaries
              and their trainers. We had to present ourselves and do all that. Other
              than that we had to go to the office to do all the office things. I am
              still not sure what I do. I have just filed papers. We also got to eat
              dinner with the new missionaries going outside of Cochabamba. Me and
              Christensen ate like a whole pizza on our own. Other than that, we
              just had a boring day.<br><br>
              
              Thursday- We just did office things all day. There hasnt been a lot of
              missionary work going on here in Cobija the last few... years, because
              the secretaries have a shady past. Lets just say about 2 years ago the
              secretaries bought a laptop... and a year ago they bought a microwave
              for the house. My goal is to make this place a bit more obedient and
              actually have investigators.<br><br>
              
              Friday- We had our zone meeting. Our zone is ridiculously awesome. I
              literally like every person in our zone. It is full of people from
              argentina, which is weird for this mission. We have 5 of the 10ish or
              so argentinos in the mission. After that we had our weekly meetings
              with the Zone leaders of Cochabamba. We meet with them and talk about
              what they used the money for and stuff. It is cool cause most all the
              zone leaders are people that are my friends in the mission. We also
              have been hanging out with Elder Edmonds, who is my friend from
              Alamos. He is training in Potosi, but he has had problems with his ID,
              so he had to stay here for a few days. He ended up going back to
              Potosi on a bus. We taught a lesson to one of the first converts in
              all of Cocha... but he is less active. People here go inactive for
              anything you can imagine.<br><br>
              
              Saturday- We actually got to work more. We just talked to less actives
              and stuff. It was good to actually work. Elder Gallegos walks really
              really fast and doesnt talk in the street, so it makes the day
              somewhat stressful. We also worked with this new kiosk program. We
              have this kiosk we put in some popular place that has questions on it
              and hope people look at it. It didnt work very well. We lost all hope
              and I even started juggling, but that didnt work either. Finally I
              just got up and talked to some girl that was crying and she seemed
              interested, so the day wasnt a complete failure.<br><br>
              
              Sunday- Church as usual. I met a family that was visiting relatives.
              They are Bolivians, but they live in Sugarhouse. We ate lunch with the
              2nd counselors family. He attended UVU and lived in Orem. Literally
              90% of the ward has travelled to the USA, while in Jardin like 2%
              maximum. We contacted a little bit. I usually just spend the nights in
              the house talking to Elder Christensen, we get along pretty well.<br><br>
              
              Monday- We played wallyball (indoor volleyball) with the zone. It was
              so fun and I really love the zone. I am excited for the next few
              months with these people. We ate pizza and them came to the office. I
              had to wait a while to use the computer because Elder Gallegos was
              printing Magic the Gathering (ask griffin) cards off so he can play
              with one of his friends. He is a good missionary, except when it comes
              to that game. I some day dream of taking all the cards and burning
              them and using the fire to roast smores.<br><br>
              
              So that is my week. My pensionista is pretty cool. We eat with 6 other
              missionaries there, so it is a party. Every day brings something
              different here in the office. President wrote me today and said that
              as a secretary I will be the face of the mission, as in if I do
              something disobedient everyone will know. Pressure...I dont do
              anything very disobediently, so I feel fine. Anyways, that is what
              happened this week. This next one will probably be just as
              interesting. Love you all, thanks for everything.<br>

                        <p>First day on the job. I got here at like 7:30, and we directly went to the airport. I definitely did the best part of the job today, receiving the new missionaries. Like 10 got here from the Columbia MTC, all gringos. It is so fun to explain to everyone how Bolivia is and all that. Just 10 months ago, me and Elder Christensen were getting here, and now we are picking people up. It is cool to see the difference from 10 months ago till now. Most everyone that got here are sisters, 9/10, but it was still cool. We took them to the hotel, mission home, and all that. My first day was cool. We ate lunch at Luigi's, and had burritos for dinner. There are a lot of luxuries to being secretary. I got to be in the offices and all that. My comps for the next 2 days are Elder Gallegos (Argentina, 28yrs old, been in the office for 9 months, training me), Elder Ortiz (Dominican Republic, 26yrs old, leaving the offices, training E' Prado), and Elder Prado (Ecuador, 19yrs old, just entering the offices). Ortiz is like the funniest guy ever. He dances all the time and is just awesome. Gallegos is really good at his job, but not so great with people. We get along though. Both of them speak english very well. Prado is kinda young, but he has potential. I'm back to living with E' Christensen (who they call Jerry for some reason) after 10 months. As far as today goes, I like being a secretary.</p>

                        <p>The house here is pretty nice. 2 floors, a little frontyard, 1 room downstairs along with a kitchen, a bathroom, and big family roomish place. Upstairs it has 4 rooms and a bathroom. We have a microwave and everything. Today we basically just had the big training meeting. I got to see Elder Edmonds and Alexander, friends from Alamos. I can't really remember what else happened. We worked in the office doing a bunch of things. Opening my bank account and all that. The training was kinda boring, but there were some good messages. We ate at the pensionista's house for lunch. She is pretty cool, and her husband too. We eat with 2 other secretaries, as well as the 4 Hnas from our 2 wards. We ate pizza for dinner. All the missionaries going outside of Cocha ate there, but they all showed up late, so me and Christensen basically ate a whole pizza by ourselves. Since the room I would normally sleep in already had Ortiz and Gallegos in it, I set up my "room" on one of the empty beds downstairs. It is a maximum of 9x9ft sq. Living the high life. I'm pretty sure there 2 days have been the easiest as a secretary, but I have enjoyed them. Very different than the normal life.</p>

                        <p>I really don't remember much about today. I remember that we got up and found out E' Edmonds couldn't fly to Sucre because he didn't have his ID. Now everytime I see Edmonds I just called him an idiot, jokingly, but I have a point. He got here late because he didn't have his ID, because of that he came in a bus. Then he got here and can't leave, because he doesn't have ID. Freaking Edmonds. I love the kid, but still... Other than that, we just spent time doing office stuff all day. We did, however, visit the bishop. He's pretty cool, and had lots of cool mission stories. It is crazy the change from El Paso to the offices. I went from cows, cholitas, stone/dirt street, and paying for trufis to a 8th story office with air conditioning, taking taxis, and seeing streets that have names. It really is like a different country. I still haven't taught a lesson yet, but we will focus on that stuff later.</p>

                      <p>Well, I actually got to be a missionary today. We had our district and zone meetings today, just like regular missionaries. Elder Vasquez is our DL. We only have 2 hermanas and the 4 secretaries in our district, so it is small. Our zone is awesome. There really aren't any missionaries that I don't like, and everyone is a good missionary. Elder Saad (Argentina) and Elder Laidlaw (Los Angeles) are the ZLs. There are 5 argentinos in the zone. I think that's a new record. After the meetings and lunch, we went to the office to have meetings with Zone Leaders about the funds they used. I just kinda sat there and let/needed to let Gallegos do it. It isn't too confusing. I got to see a bunch of my friends like Elder Watts, Manning, Mickle, Meadows, Lopez, and Delgadillo. After that we actually taught a lesson. We taught this old couple of less actives. They were some of the first converts in Cochabamba. Their kids served missions and all that, but... they aren't active. People always come up with excuses to not come to church. They were regular old people, as in they like telling stories from their lives. Oh well, at least we taught a lesson. Tomorrow we teach the whole day, something I'm used to.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <p>Well, we didn't exactly teach <u>all</u> day, but we did do something useful. We got up and did more secretary stuff. I finally finished opening my bank account. Pretty sure the lady at the bank was snaking on me though, so that's weird. We had lunch with some members, along with the sister missionaries in our ward. One of the members was a cholita, and is like the only one I've met here. Different from El Paso, where everyone is a cholita. The sisters in our ward are Hna Francia from La Paz, and Hna Hansen from Idaho. It's weird because Hna Hansen is allergic to potatoes. Anyawys, after that we had to go use the kiosk thing. It is some new program where we set up this stand with a few questions (like "How can I find peace" or "Why am I here"). Then we put it in a crowded place and hope people come and look at the kiosk, then we contact them. Apparently it works really well sometimes, but for us it didn't do anything. People would pass by and it was like the kiosk was invisible. I was surprised no one ran into it. Afte hours of nothing, I started juggling in the middle of the street... still nothing. Really, the only bit of success we had was that I saw this girl crying, so me and Prado went and contacted her. She was mildly interested at least. Needless to say, I didn't like the kiosk very much. After that we just had a lesson with a recent convert/less active that was good, and then we went home. End to a relatively boring day.</p>

                    <p>Well, Sundays are the same for office missionaries as they are for regular missionaries. We got up and had "ward counsel" at 9. It was the same as any other ward; where nothing happens. There was the 2nd counselor and some primary lady. Nothing really important. At church, we had about 100 people there. Not awful. The ward seems dead though. There's like no youth, so it is boring. For the second and third hour, we had some special meeting about family history. I really like family history, but it was a boring meeting and family history isn't that interesting when you're a missionary. I definitely kinda fell asleep. After the meeting, we had lunch with the 2nd counselor. He is pretty cool. He lived in Utah for a long time and went to UVU. His daughter is obsessed with Ice Cream. It is really funny. After that we walked around and did missionary like things. We talked to a less active guy and then contacted some reference. It wasn't exactly the most exciting, but it was important. It allowed me to see the level of the ward and what it needs. We have a long way to go.</p>

                    <p>P-day. The most important day as a secretary. We are so stressed with everything throughout the week, that relaxing on p-day is important. We had been talking about going to the Laguna Alalay to go running, but nobody wanted to go in the morning. Good thing, I really didn't want to go. We played wallyball as a zone. It was soooooooooooooooooooo fun. The zone is ridiculously awesome, and surprisingly athletic. We played for like 2 hours nonstop. I think I only lost 1 time the whole 2 hours. It was fun with Elder Christiansen (Jerry), Elder Alexander, Elder Laidlaw, Elder Valerio, Elder Skousen and all the other people. We were always setting it and actually spiking and stuff. It looked professional. After lots of practicing we even got it where Elder Skousen would set it and I jumped off Valerio's back to spike it. One of my favorite p-day athletic activities. After that we went and ate pizza with the zone as well. Then we went to the office. For p-day we do that to write email, it is so much better than an internet cafe. Gallegos spent his time printing magic the gathering cards. Then he made up drop him off so he could play with his friend. That bugged me, but oh well. At night Gallegos gave me a lesson on the importance of what we do and all that. It was good to explain to me everything. Overall, a good p-day, and I really like my zone.</p>
