            <h1>Week 2 <small>(June 4, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>525600 Minutes</h3>
            <p><small>FAMILY,<br>
                Well, finally, I am writing my big letter. I am really sorry that I
              didnt get to write it earlier, but we were really busy. Like once a
              year, there is an audit from the country office (Santa Cruz), and they
              sent us an email and told us it would be this week, thursday and
              friday. On top of that, the area office wanted to come and see how the
              office was running to make sure it will be good for the next
              president. That was this morning and later this week. 7 guys came in
              in their suits and looked like the CIA. Now I understand why people
              think we look like that. I am going to go through the last 9 or so
              days so you can get an idea of what my life is like now.
              Monday- After I wrote you, we just stayed at the office and worked.
              Just a regular day.<br>
              Tuesday- We had our district meeting (the district is kinda lame cause
              we are just 6 missionaries, and 4 of us are secretaries). After the
              meeting we had to rush to lunch and then to the offices because every
              tuesday we have meetings with each pair of Zone Leaders, for a half
              hour each. I review all of their financieros (they report what they
              used their money to reimburse). They are supposed to use money to
              reimburse medical problems, house problems, transportation for mission
              things (interviews etc) and all that. Usually, the Zone Leaders do
              pretty well about reporting all of their money, so there arent any
              problems. We do that until about 6ish. After that, I stayed at the
              office until 10 because we had to finish up with President and Hermana
              Dyer´s finances. We usually do it before the 25th, but they were
              travelling in Sucre and Potosi, so we had to do it on the 27th. That
              is pretty late to do it, so we had to stay at the office until 10 to
              get it done. It was a very long night.<br>
              Wednesday- Wednesday was kinda boring. The only thing I remember was
              that we went out to lunch with all the secretaries and assistants as a
              kind of reward. We went to a place called Puerto Madero, which is a
              nice buffet place. It was amazing. Actually, I am not sure it would be
              super nice in Utah, but for Bolivia it is nice. We ate fried bananas,
              seafood (first and probably last for my mission), crepes, a whole
              bunch of fruit, and all that good stuff. We ate so much and we were
              ready to explode after, but it was worth it. One of my pictures is of
              the crepes.<br>
              Thursday- Cant really remember<br>
              Friday- We ate lunch at the mission home. That was pretty cool. We ate
              tacos and pie and stuff. I felt so out of place, eating all fancy with
              President and Hna Dyer. I get along well with most of the secretaries
              and both assistant. Just sometimes Elder Prado and Elder Vasquez are
              difficult to work with. Nice, but difficult to work with. That was the
              good part of Friday, but there was also a bad part. We had to help out
              Pres Dyer because he was in a disciplinary counsel. 1 missionary had
              some problems (I dont know what, but you can imagine), and as a result
              he and 2 others were sent home. It is hard to see that, especially
              since the guy that was at the center only had 2 weeks left in his
              mission.<br>
              Saturday- I had my interview with President Dyer. It was good for my
              last interview. He told me a lot of cool things that I need to do. I
              basically need to be perfect, or good enough so everyone thinks I am
              perfect. He said all the success of the mission depends on the office.
              No pressure.<br>
              Sunday- Regular sunday. Just church and one appointment with a less
              active. Good enough.<br>
              Monday- We didnt really have that spectacular of a p day. Just
              haircut, lunch, and working. This whole audit thing is a lot of
              pressure. We stayed until like 10:30 doing the paperwork<br>
              Tuesday- It was kinda boring. Just finishing up the paperwork in the
              morning and my zone leader meetings in the afternoon. Also, because we
              are secretaries, a lot of people are staying at our house. In my room
              it is me, Gallegos, and Prado. In the other is Christensen, Vasquez,
              and Calderon (Vasquez´s replacement). Downstairs we have some 10 or so
              people. It is so crowded, but fun at the same time because there are
              people like Elder Edmonds (friend from the last zone), Elder Thomson
              (Elder Lopez trained him too) and Elder Callahua (he is in
              Churuquella). The house is really packed though<br>
              Wednesday- We got up today and played basketball. Me, Christensen,
              Thomson, Calderon, Elder Atwood and Elder Crankshaw went and played at
              6. It was fun, but cold. Then I had to give a presentation to the zone
              leaders of what they are doing wrong, and then I just came back and
              worked. That is really everything that happened this week.<br>
              I am close to being a full secretary now. It is still very stressful
              at times because EVERYONE asks for money, when they will have money,
              where there money is, and all that. I am going to be so tired when I
              finish up here. I put 525600 minutes because I will be home 1 year
              from yesterday. Crazy how fast the time flies. I am glad I finally got
              to write you guys. I love you, and I will hopefully talk to you on
              Monday next week. There isnt an audit, so hopefully it will be normal.
              Love,<br>
                 Elder Bagley</small></p>

                        <p>Well, first off, it is Bolivian mother's day, doesn't really mean anything for a North American missionary, but it is a fun fact. We had our district meetings in the morning. Good enough I guess. I got into a small arguement with E' Gallegos because he made us stand up in the middle of a spiritual thought because we were apparently in a rush (we weren't). His attitude rubbed me the wrong way. We cleared it up though, so it's all good. I almost did all of the zone leader meetings all by myself. It really isn't too hard, but at least I can do some things on my own now. After all these meetings, the nightmare started. We had to balance out President Dyer's money, so we don't owe money and he doesn't owe money. We had to finish it that night though, so as to follow the deadlines they gave us. We didn't leave the office until 10 at night. It was awful, and so boring. After that, we went to go buy a pizza, and after opening the pizza, we found out it was really small. It was a poor finish to an exhausting night. I have a feeling I will have a few nights like this in my time in the office.</p>

                        <p>I can't remember too much of what happened today, except for one thing. Today, as a kind of special reward lunch for the office missionaries, we all went out to eat at a place called Puerto Madero. It is a buffet place and it was soo good. We ate things like fried bananas, shrimp, yucca, crepes, watermelon, grapes, and a whole bunch of other things I never get to eat here in Bolivia. It was fun to hang out will all the office guys. I get along really well with Elder Christensen and Elder Weekes. This whole office thing is kinda stressful at times, but it does have its benefits. It's bad that I can't remember anything else, but oh well, Puerto Madero is good enough to fill the whole day's entry.</p>

                        <p>Yet again, not too much to say about today, but there are 2 things to touch on, 1 good and 1 bad. First the good. I really love eating at my pensionista's house. Firstly, she is cool. Her name is Better and she is one of those people you can just joke around with. Other than that, I like eating with Elder Christiansen, Hna Brindley, and Hna Rumualdo (aka Hna Ramaluk). I get along with all them and we joke around a bunch. Everyone is starting to realize the importance of the word llajta. All the others that eat there are E' Gallegos, Prado, and Vasquez along with Hna Francia and Hna Hansen. Not that I don't like them, but they are all just kinda boring. Now, the bad part. At about 6ish, I came out of my office. I turned the corner, and who did I see, but Elder Cortez. Now, that wouldn't be a big deal, but he is currently serving in Sucre, so seeing him meant something had happened. Apparently, this guy, Elder Corrales, did some stuff, and is getting sent home early (like 2 weeks early). Elder Cortez was his companion at the time (then later a guy named Elder Castro) and all three of them will be here tomorrow for the disciplinary counsel. It really sucks to see these problems in the mission. However, I guess missionaries aren't immune to the world. I think Satan works even harder on us.</p>

                      <h3>May 30, 2014</h3>
                      <p>Very interesting day. Ups and downs. First important thing of the day was the disciplinary counsel. Elder Corrales was the main focus. Not really sure what he did, but I can imagine after seeing all the stuff that is going on. Not anything I ever want to go through, a counsel (it is council? I really think I am forgetting how to spell). It was weird though, cause Cortez and Castro don't seem that worried about it. I would be devastated. It was a long process in the morning, but it finally ended. Found out the mission president's secretary is Saul Rojas, this guy from my old ward. Never knew that. After that we went to eat lunch at the mission home. It was all the current secretaries, the assistants, the Dyers, Sonia, and 2 former secretaries, Elder Ortiz and Elder Feddock. I like Ortiz, but not a big fan of Feddock. We ate tacos and it was awesome. After that we had pie. Benefits of being a secretary. I had a good time with Elder Weekes, just messin around and stuff. After that we just went back to the offices and worked for the rest of the day. It is really dissappointing the whole Corralez situations. 2 (Correlez and Cortez) and possibly 3 (Castro maybe) missionaries are going home because of some really poor decisions. I think if they would have been doing the little things (praying, reading, etc...) they would've never had this happen. But, as we walk farther and farther away from righteousness, the easier it is to do worse things.</p>

                    <h3>May 31, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Well, it is the last day of may. That went really fast. I can't remember much about today, but I do remember 3 things. First, Elder Cortez and Elder Corralez went home. Kinda opposite situations, one went home after 5 months when he had his whole mission ahead of him, and the other went home when he only had 2 weeks left on his mission. One threw away his future in the mission, and the other threw away everything we had done for 2 years, sad stuff. The second thing is that we went to lunch at this member's house. We always eat with Hna Francia and Hna Hansen, but for some reason I feel like they don't like me. Oh well, not my problem. We saw a fake Mona Lisa painting in the hosue, so I naturally posed like the Mona Lisa and took a picture. The third thing was my final interview with President Dyer. I was worried that I would just have a regular boring interview, where he tells me I'm a good missionary and "que siga adelanta Elder". On the contrary, it was a great interview. He immediately started off by talking about being a secretary. He told me 6 important things. 1) Teach always, even in the office I still can teach other missionaries. 2) This opportunity will have a big impact on my life. 3) I need integrity and honesty. 4) I <u>can</u> ask for help, I can't do it alone. 5) I need to be spotless, perfect enough so that other missionaries think I'm perfect. 6) As the office goes, the mission goes. We are important. I really enjoyed the interview. It was a great last one, and I learned a lot. President Dyer has been a great president and will be missed. Good way to end May, but I'm ready to start June.</p>

                    <h3>June 1, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Well, there goes May. I'm now in the same month as when I started my mission. Time goes by so fast. In just 18 days, I will complete a year. The mission is going to be over before I know it. Today was just a regular Sunday. We went to church as normal. We had ward counsel, but no one really goes, so it is kinda boring and useless. We've got work to do here. In Elders Quorum I tried so hard not fall asleep, but my attempts were in vain. After church we had lunch with this single mom and her 4 daughters. It was a good lunch, and I was cracking a lot of jokes. We were speaking very grammatically incorrect, such as "la problema, la sistema, el mano, el calle," and all that. It was funny. To end the day, we had a lesson with this less active. He used to be in a bishopric, but doesn't go now. I don't really understand how that can happen. He even has a strong testimony. It just doesn't make sense. We'll do our best. I'm tired, so I guess I'll go to sleep now.</p>

                    <p>Well, today was a boring p-day. Due to the fact that we have an important audit this week, we had to stay at the office in order to organize everything. The only break we had during the whole day was when the people cam to clean the carpet, that's when we went to lunch. We ate with the zone, so that was fun. I ate some cheese frieds, which would later come back to make me sick. Awfully sick. After hours and hours (dI didn't even get time to write my family) we finished at like 10. We did take a small break, where me, Christensen, Gallegos, Weekes, and Mero went to Eli's to eat burritos. Other than that, it was just a boring day. I'm going to be really thankful once I get the whole audit thing over, it is just taking a lot of time and energy to get ready for it.</p>
