            <h1>Week 3 <small>(February 10, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Here comes the BOOM</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
                This was perhaps one of the longest weeks of my mission so far. We
             got hit by a bunch of things we had to do that we didnt have control
             over. Every day brought something completely new. I will go day by day
             so you understand what I mean.<br>
             Monday- We played Wallyball with the district, went to eat lunch, and
             ya. However, at night, we had the loudest thunderstorm I have ever
             heard. The lighting literally lit up our room so that we couldnt
             sleep, and there were thundercracks so loud that it was actually kinda
             scary. I fell asleep at 1:30 that night.<br>
             Tuesday- Tuesday we had to go with Juan Carlos, a recent convert, to
             the hospital. He is a 21 year old kid, but he is a bit odd to say the
             least. He cut 3 of his fingers open working, but didnt do anything
             about it, so 1 got infected. In the morning we went to the health
             center in El Paso. After lunch we went down to Cochabamba the city
             because we had a guy there that could help us for free, but we got to
             Cocha and he wasnt working that day, so we had to go all the way over
             to Quillacollo (look it up on a map) and finally got in. We were doing
             that from 8-10 and then 2-6:30. Long day<br>
             Wednesday- Elder Hernandez was sick, so we stayed home. Staying home
             is ok for like 3 hours, but then it gets boring. Nothing much else
             happened today.<br>
             Thursday- We actually got to work, but at night it was a long day. We
             went to the church for our weekly meeting with the ward mission
             leader, but he wasnt there (see Friday). We had to stay there to train
             our ward missionaries, and then wait for the bishop to talk to one of
             our less active families. We got home at 10:30<br>
             Friday- We spent it at the court... What happened is our ward mission
             leader owns a car dealership, but on wednesday one of his employees
             hit a motorcyclist in one of the cars, so he had to go to a trial. Our
             WML too cause it is his company. Well, he asked for our help, so we
             came with. Everything came out ok (motorcyclist was drunk, ran a red
             light, and will be 100% in 4 months). We played soccer at night to
             celebrate everything going ok. Cool experience, the kid that went to
             jail for a day (the employee) is the son of an adventist pastor. He
             never went to another church besides that one, but after this
             experience, he went to an LDS church where he lives yesterday and
             wants to hear the missionaries cause we were the only ones there to
             help him<br>
             Saturday- Spent a lot of it calling Hernandez´s family. What happened
             is that his mom and sister were robbed and are in the hospital right
             now, but he has no contact with them, so he was calling relatives to
             see what happened. He has had a headache all week from worrying about
             his family, that is part of the reason he was sick. We are gonna hear
             today how things are going<br>
             Sunday- Picked up investigators for church, and then just had a
             regular sunday. At night, Jorge (ward mission leader, aka Coco) came
             over and we had an hour and a half talk between the five of us about
             how to do better. This ward is amazing and Jorge helps us so much. He
             is just an exciting guy and has changed the work in this ward. He was
             assistant on his mission in Colombia for 15 months, so he knows what
             he is doing.
             <br><br>
             Overall, things are getting better. Me and Elder Hernandez still have
             rough times, but overall we are getting better. As far as
             investigators, the best ones so far are the Familia Condori. About 8
             months ago, the mom was going to commit suicide and kill her whole
             family, but about 10 minutes before she was gonna do it, the
             missionaries showed up (Elder Diazgranados was one, he was my DL in
             Sucre). Well, the church as changed their life, but they are still
             reluctant for baptism. We barely got contact with them again, and I
             think things could really improve. Not much else to say. I love you
             guys, and keep it up. Just help the missionaries, and all will go
             well. <br><br>Qanta Munakwiki (I love you)<br>

                      <h3>February 4, 2014</h3>
                      <p>Today was a long day. We started out by going, wait, scratch that. Last night was probably one of the loudest and brightest thunderstorms I have experienced. The thundercracks were super loud and the lightning strikes lit up the house everytime. I said a prayer cause I was even a little scared. I didn't sleep till 1:30. Crazy stuff. It knocked down a bunch of electric wires and even a big market sign. Back to what I was saying, we started by going with Juan Carlos, a recent convert, to the doctor. It is important to know that he's a bit odd. About a week ago he cut his hand working, but didn't want to tell anyone until we found out on Sunday. Well, he thought it was infected, so we went to the medical center here. Well, one finger was infected, so we had to go to the hospital with him after lunch. We called Jorge and he told us he had a doctor friend in Cocha that could do it for free, so we went there. Well, he wasn't working today, and no one else in the hospital could help us, so we had to go to Quillacollo. In Quillacollo everything turned out ok, but we were dead tired. Well, we got back to El PAso, and ended up meeting a lady by helping her carry her bags. We had an FHE with the Flia Vaca as well. Sometimes I really like my comp, others I just want to throw a brick at his face. Today was overall better though.</p>

                    <h3>February 5, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Everyday here in El Paso is different. Today we woke up and Lopez and Hernandez were sick. Like actually sick, not Diazgranados "sick". They basically slep the majority of the day. Meaning: I reorganized my room, studied, relaxed, slept, went with Gubler to lunch, and had a boring/relaxing day. Well after a nap, Hernandez felt good enough to work. First we visisted Jacqueline, this lady that owns a clothing shop across the street. She's kinda hung up on the BoM, saying she just bases herself in the bible. We showed videos and stuff, but she just needs to read. Then we visisted this lady whose name I don't know, but owns a little dessert shop in the plaza. She's cool, but just kinda lazy. Seems like the people here are nice, just lazy to do anything. Finally we talked to the Condori family. They're some special people. Basically what happened was 10 min before the mom was going to kill herself and her family, Elder Diazgranados and Van Horn showed up. The gospel has really helped their family and they are just cool people. Then we just had dinner and ya. No one I ever live with understands the rules, so I guess I just try to make sure I'm obedient. Ready for a good day tomorrow.<br><br><br><br></p>

                    <h3>February 6, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Well, this week is turning out to be one of the longest weeks ever. Monday we did a lot of walking, too much for p-day. Tuesday we had to go with Juan Carlos to the hospital and all that. Wednesday Hernandez was sick. Today, we got home at 10:30. It all started out weird when Lopez and Gubler had to go with Jorge cause Jorge's employee got in an accident where he hit a motorcycle and broke the guy's leg. They had to pay a bunch and get the employee out of jail and just a bunch of stuff. We taught some lessons, but I think they were with mostly less actives. We had a funny experience where somehow we ended up with my talking to one lady at her door while Hernandez taught some other guy at his door. At night, we went with Braulio to the church to have him play soccer. While there, the Flia Quispe had an interview with the bishop. Thy've got some interesting things going on and the bishop says they need profesional help. Also, Hernandez's finally told me that his mom and sister were attacked and robbed, so that's why he's unfocused. I'm tired so this'll be all for tonight.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <h3>February 7, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Well, today sucked. They waste a whole lot of time here. We didn't work a single minute today. Today we "helped" Jorge with his legal thing. Everything turned out ok, but we just say in a court room for a while. It's good to help out Jorge and stuff, but Elder Gubler said something that was very true. We are here to serve God first, everyone else comes in second. If serving God comes through serving others, ya that's fine. However, if we have to break rules, that isn't great. Later we went to play soccer on a synthetic field. I shouldn't have played, but I did. I was really careful in order to not get hurt. I played well, so I got my respect I deserved. We then ate hamburgers and watched the first half of Bolivar vs. The Strongest, the big soccer rivalry in Bolivia. People are really crazy about soccer here. Even the lawyer we were with used some filthy words. Overall, just not the day I was looking for.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <h3>February 8, 2014</h3>
                    <p>This is still the longest week and weirdest one. Today continued the streak of days with hardly any work. Today wasn't like a bad excuse or anything, just not work. Hernandez is still worried about his family, and naturally so, anyone would be. We went to Tiquipaya so he could call them, but he couldn't get through. We had lunch with the Flia Orellana. The soup had no flavor, but we had a good time. Later we went to the other Flia Orellana, to teach a lesson to their 7 year old daughter that is getting baptized soon. It is different teaching a lesson to a little kid, cause we have to teach really really simply. Later we taught the Condori dad with the help of the Primary Pres, Wendy Orellana. It was good, he doesn't understand everything (kinda reminded me of Miguel Leon from Sucre), but it was all good. We went to go play soccer later, but this time I made the right decision and didn't play. I even brought all my clothes to the church, but then we just left. We went to Quillacollo to call Hernandez's family, but he still didn't get much information. We finished with Margarita's b-day party at Benita's house. Oh ya, Hernandez told me it was obvious that cat's can see the spirit world and only black cats can protect us. I called him Korihor for saying false doctrine. We've had a total of 4 lessons this week. It's awful, I just wanna work.</p>

                    <p>Sundays just take everything out of me. Every Sunday we wake up and go pick up/wake up investigators so that they'll come to church. I hate it, but it works. The ones we picked up today were Braulio and Cristian Huarayo, along with their cousin, also the little Condori girls. It was good to get someone to church, even though we showed up late to church. Church was interesting, while Lopez and Hernandez were running around doing everything, they didn't really let us (me and Gubler) in on anything, so we just say in classes. We had lunch with Hno Valentin, the first counselor. Basically me, Lopez, and Hno Valentin talked, while Hernandez and Gubler slept. We eventually had an FHE with some family in the other area. It was good, and we even got a reference out of it. We went to Benita's to get the food, and it was raining hard, but we eventually made it home. At night, we had like a 90 min talk with Jorge. He's a special guy. Told us about being more obedient, excited to work, and just a bunch of good stuff. He really makes a huge difference here. The bishop also sent us messages of encouragement randomly. I'm still trying to get along better with Hernandez. It's hard at times, but we're getting better.</p>

                    <h3>February 10, 2014</h3>
                    <p>P-day. Today was an interesting one. We started out in Quillacollo. We walked around, Hernandez bought an umbrella and that kinda stuff. We bought empanadas, but Hernandez only had 50bs, so the worker didn't have change. Hernandez was like "give me 3bs" so I asked why and he freaked out. Not sure why. Internet was good, nothing special. We went to the Cirsto statue today. It is one heck of a hike. THousands of steep stairs to get to the top. My legs were burning. While I was going up I talked to Elder Vasquez. We said it compared to life. The path is tough, but ultimately it is worth it if we get to Christ. We ate lunch at the IC Norte at the food court. I talked like the whole day to Elder Edmonds and Elder Alexander. They are cool guys and we get along well. At night, our FHE fell through at the last minute. We had the notebook of some hermana, so we went to go wait to give it to her. They told us 6:30, but showed up at 8:15. It sucked waiting, but eventually we got home. The planning sucked. It was all going well, but we got into a discussion about whether were gonna study. It looked like we weren't gonna have time in the morning, so I said we should do it in the afternoon. Hernandez said they did things differently here. I asked Elder Lopez if we should study, and he said yes, but Hernandez got me. Well we went back to plan, and I didn't get another word in. Numbers, appointment, everything... I'm literally dying here. I was almost crying talking to Lopez and Gubler about it. It's been a hard 2 weeks. I haven't been able to get along with Hernandez. He thinks he's perfect, he doesn't respect me, he's a hypocrite... Hardest companion so far. He's an angel for all the leaders, but it's an act. I'm nothing to him. I feel like my time on the mission is being wasted cause I'm not helping anything. I just wanna be happy and a good missionary.</p>
