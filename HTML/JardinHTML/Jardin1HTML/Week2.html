            <h1>Week 2 <small>(February 3, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>The rains came down and the floods came up</h3>
            <p><small>Dad, Mom, Rachel, Griffin, and others<br>
                Cómo están? Espero que hayan tenido una buena semana. Estoy
             escribiendo esta carta en español para ver como es el español de
             todos. Tal vez para mostrar el mio tambien. Creo que ya puedo decir
             que hablo dos idiomas, y estoy intentando a aprender Quechua tambien.
             Espero que los Jazz vayan. Ok, just wanted to throw some spanish out
             there. Last week was definitely a big change, but I am finally getting
             into a grove here in El Paso. This area is 100% different than Sucre.
             In Sucre, my area was a tourist, catholic, richer area with smaller
             houses, streets, and all that. Here in El Paso, it is farm land that
             is green, and all but a few of the roads are dirt. When we heard my
             call for Bolivia, Cochabamba, this is what we imagined. The reason for
             the title is that is has been raining so much here. We have to walk
             through the mud to get everywhere. It is messy. This week was pretty
             good. I still dont know everything about the area, but I am getting
             there quickly. We have been visiting a lot of the members, active and
             less active, so I can get to know them. The pictures from the temple
             are ones we took with them. As far as investigators, we did somehow
             get 7 people to church yesterday, which was good. The attendance
             overall yesterday was 230, which is more than double that of Sucre. We
             have been looking for the old investigators in the area, because Elder
             Hernandez wasnt able to work for the last 4 week because his comp
             broke his foot. We are getting things going though. Every Sunday there
             is a trufi (basically the big vans that the families with a lot of
             kids buy) and that takes everyone from El Paso to the chapel, which is
             about 15-20 minutes away. Sunday it was so full that me and Elder
             Hernandez had to take a seperate trufi. The ward here is Jardin, we
             are Jardin 2, and it is amazing. Our ward mission leader is like the
             best one in the world. He is always helping us in everything. The
             bishop is great too. He and Jorge, WML, will just call random meetings
             to ask what they can help with. They called a bunch of ward
             missionaries and have given them PMG, manuals, and everything they
             need. They spend a lot of their own money to help the work. One cool
             experience about this week was when we went with the Relief Society
             President to go deliver bags of food to some poorer families in the
             area. It was cool to see how excited the kids got when they got the
             food. There are 2 pictures that are from that experience. Walking
             through a bunch of mud carry a heavy bag of food on my back was
             something that I will remember. As far as my companion, we are getting
             better. He is really different from me, so sometimes we butt heads. I
             like to stay calm and have a plan. He worries a lot and just is...
             different. We had a time this week that I had to stand up and leave
             the room during our weekly planning, cause he kept cutting me off and
             wouldnt let me give my opinion. I had to leave or we wouldve argued
             more. We are trying to get along better though, and although there are
             ups and downs, it is overall better. I have fooled 2 people into
             thinking I was from Brazil, so my gringo accent is changing. I am
             trying to learn Quechua now, someone gave me a book, so hopefully soon
             I will speak pure Lamanite. Anyways, I am enjoying my time here, and I
             know without a doubt that the gospel is true. <br>Love you guys, <br><br>Les
             Quiero, Qanta Munani<br>

                      <p>This Hernandez kid is gonna be the end of me. He's so hard to work with. He's never been wrong, ever in his life, he's thinks he's perfect and the best missionary, and he's a huge hypocrite. He just tests my patience so much. I'd punch him if I could. He gets so mad at everything, all he does is talk about how bad his first cambio was (he goes as far as questioning if President Dyer's revelation is wrong) and... AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! That's how I feel. He takes a truki for 10min walks, he basically whispers a baptismal challenge, and when they don't hear or respond, he counts it as a set date. I don't know if I can make it with this kid, I might die or throw a punch first. Uh, then he just laughs at everything. I don't want this journel entry to just be venting, but that's all that's going through my head. Now is as big a moment as ever when I really need the Lord's help. Oh ya, he dropped the cell phone in a puddle and would've left it there on accident if I didn't pick it up. Anyways, just sitting here trusting that this is what God wants.</p>

                    <p>Well, today was just kinda uneventful. Really, my favorite part was my personal study. Mosiah 14 is a cool chapter. We didn't really do anything else cause Hernandez went to sleep. At lunch we had chili and fajitas. Hna Benita is a really good cook. I also talked to the Flia Augirre on the phone. In the afternoon we visited like 3 less-active families. Hernandez like working, but he just doesn't really know how to do it. We got along better today though, so that's good. At night we had FHE with Hna Benita's family. It was good, it just bugs me sometimes that Hernandez teaches like a robot. It is just repeated phrases, and he doesn't listen. We've got work to do with him, but we'll get there. Apparantly a GA is coming March 19th, so that'll be cool. I am really starting to like Elder Gubler. He's a humble guy and just wants to be a good missionary. He even just barely came in and thanked me for helping him. Maybe not a great work day, but I feel like I made progress in other things.</p>

                    <p>Wow, I've already been here for a week. It seems like it was forever ago that I was in Sucre. Today started out rough, but it ended well. Me and Elder Gubler went running this morning. I never knew it was so hard to run. I got tired after just a few minutes. I can walk all day, but running is hard. We had weekly planning. Me and Hernandez got in an arguement, during which I had to get up and leave in order to not argue anymore. However, we worked it out later and we actually have been a lot better since then. We had a lesson with a lady named Jacqueline. She seems pretty interested. It was the first lesson where we worked well together. We talked to Benita, our pensionista, and learned she's cooked for Elder Holland, Elder Nelson, and is just awesome. We had a meeting with the mission leader, high counselor, and eventually the bishop about helping the ward, that the ZL's are giving unreal statistics of our ward, and just a good meeting. Our leaders here are great. I also played piano with Gubler. Me and him get along great. We have good talks at night. This week hasn't been great, but I'm starting to get to know the area now, and hopefully I can really help it soon.</p>

                    <p>And there goes January. That was fast. I'm really tired, so I'm gonna make this one quick. We visited some less actives today. We went to the birthday party of the kids of one of the families. Along with the Relief Society Pres, we brought them some toys and a bunch of food. Later, we went with the Relief Society Pres to take some food to an investigator family. It's been raining really hard here, so the streets are basically pure mud at this point. It his hard work to walk through the back country of El Paso in the mud. My shoes are pure brown at this point. Finally, we had an FHE with the Flia. Siles. We talked about the atonement, and it was spiritual. I did a good job getting the family to like me, we were laughing a bunch. I also got a book of Quechua, so I'm gonna try to learn that now. That's all I got for today, ready for February.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <h3>February 1, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Today was interesting. Today we went to the temple. I had a really weird experience there. We went with the Flia. Quispe, a less active family. Well, they don't have recommends, so they were just gonna go to the visitor's center. Elder Lopez and Elder Gubler were there too, so they said I could go do baptisms with them while Hernandez stayed with the family. Well I actually got in the temple, but for some reason I felt like I should leave. Well, so naturally I left. I just think I didn't want to enter the temple when I shouldn't have been entering. I feel better now, but it weighed on my mind for a while. We had a lesson with Jacqueline, which was good. She thinks she got an answer to her prayers cause she saw a Christian Church, but we told her to pray again. We also talked to this family, Flia Guarayo. They're cool, and they said they want to come to church tomorrow. I've learned how to make people laugh here, speak a little bit of Quechua and they die of laughter. Anyways, I'm hoping for a good day tomorrow, with like a billion people at church.</p>

                    <h3>February 2, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Well, last night I wrote I wanted a lot of people to come to church, and that happened. The trufi was so full that we had to take a different one. We had about 230 people at church, and 7 were our investigators. We were super happy. Church was good, but I kinda fell asleep in sacrament meeting. We always just have spur of the moment meetings with Jorge, the ward mission leader. He's just super great. Him and the bishop and all the leaders support us. There's just a good feeling in the  ward. For example, they called a bunch of ward missionaries today and then had a small meeting with them and the bishop; he's gonna give them all PMGs, manuals, and everything. We didn't really have any success today. Hernandez just likes talking to members, so we do that a lot. It's still hard to get along with Hernandez. We have like 3 or 4 days spaces where we get along, but then something just happens where we lost it. I don't know if it's me or him, but I need to fix it. Sometimes I just want to punch him in the face though. It's for some good reason, so I just hope I find out the reason the Lord wants me with him.</p>

                    <p>Today was very interesting. It was p-day, and it started weird. I woke up to Hernandez taking my blanket off in order to wake me up. I didn't like that, but oh well. We got haircuts today. Found out that the Cochabamba newspapers all have Asian porn on the back, so that's something new. We went to a far away place to play wallyball, but it was closed. After discussion though, we did end up playing with just the district. I got to know Elder Edmonds and Alexander a little better too. We later went to IC Norte to eat and shop. It's like an actual supermarket. I had been annoyed by Elder Hernandez basically the whole day, and I even threw my wallet at him and later my bad of dirty clothes. I learned that I throw things when I'm mad. Well, we had an FHE and I talked to Elder Gubler and that helped a lot. In the FHE, we heard an Elder Eyring talk. He talked about Priesthood duty. I've seen the video like 400 times, but that part hit me today. I need to make sure I'm not being lazy, especially in trying to fix my companionship. I also realized Hernandez is really stressed right now so I need to focus on how I can help him, more than focus how he needs to change.</p>
