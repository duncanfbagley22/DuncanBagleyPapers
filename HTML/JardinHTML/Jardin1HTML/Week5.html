            <h1>Week 5 <small>(February 24, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Tatay, Mamay, Panay, Wawqiy, Awichus, Kakays, Ipays, Ayllu, y Kawsaqiys</h3>
            <p><small>
            How are you all doing?<br> This was a pretty fast week, but slow at
            the same time. The mission is kinda always like that. I´ll go day by
            day, but I will still probably forget stuff.<br>
            Monday- We went to the big stake center here and played 5 on 5
            basketball with just gringos. It was fun. Elder Christiansen was there
            too. Also I got to see Elder Lopez my trainer. He left to Venezuela
            this week, so it was good to see him one last time.<br>
            Tuesday- There was a baptism in the ward, so we went to that. After
            the little girl had a birthday party with a clown, and I wanted to
            leave, but my comp wanted to stay cause going back to the area was a
            waste of time. Hmmmm... We wasted a lot of time, and then later I went
            home with Elder Gubler cause he was sick.<br>
            Wednesday- Hernandez was kinda sick I guess, so we stayed home. I
            organized my room, and then slept. Not much else<br>
            Thursday and Friday- these are just the days that pass quickly and no
            one really notices. Not sure what happened.<br>
            Saturday- We went with a family in the ward to look for a house for
            them, but we didnt find anything. Later the other elders in our ward
            had a baptism, so I went to that. After we went to a BBQ at Jorge´s
            house cause his family was in town. We wasted time there too, but
            anytime I argue my comp says that is how to work with the members...
            waste lots of time. Also, that night Hernandez was really mad at me,
            but I literally had no idea why. Well, we got home and he told me
            there was 2 reasons. 1) Cause I went away at the BBQ to talk to Elder
            Gubler cause he asked me for advice cause he is having a rough time. I
            forgot to tell Hernandez I was going inside (yes, my fault). 2) I
            wouldnt let him use the phone to call his friend in another area.
            Basically I followed the rules. We talked for a while about our
            relationship and stuff, and ironed out some stuff. Also, Elder Gubler
            and Elder Lopez fixed their relationship. It ended up being a
            productive talk between the 4 of us and at least no one hates each
            other now. We fell asleep at 1 though, there was a lot to talk about.
            Sunday- We had church, like always. After church for some reason we
            went to the hospital. Elder Lopez´s old pensionista is in the hospital
            with cancer, so he wanted to see her. Hernandez basically worships
            Lopez, so we went too. I cant say no, cause then he whines, gets
            ´´sick´´ and we dont leave the house. Kinda a waste of time for the 2
            of us, but oh well. Sunday was also the night of cambios. Here is what
            is happening:<br>
            Elder Lopez- going to Potosi<br>
            Elder Gubler- staying, going to have a new comp named elder Apasa<br>
            Elder Hernandez- going to Pagador, another area in Cocha<br>
            Elder Bagley- staying in El Paso, going to have Elder Muñoz (dont know
            him), and is going to be District Leader (42 day DL at least)<br>
              That whole District Leader part is scary for me. Now I have to teach
            a class to the district once a week, do a lot of intercambios, and
            give baptismal interviews. A lot more responsibilities. I´ll be
            honest, it scared me at first, but I will learn as we go. As far as my
            comp, no heartbroken that he is leaving, but glad at least that we are
            ending on good terms. He is kinda mad at President and mad about
            leaving, but oh well, it is God´s will. I will go pick up my new comp
            tomorrow. As far as investigators, 3 are doing well. Braulio and
            Cristian were going to get baptized, but it fell through cause their
            mom said they need more time to prepare. She is going to come to
            church next week though. Also, we are teaching circus performers now.
            I cant remember their names, but they are cool. They might be moving
            in a week, but they are still progressing well for now. They came to
            church yesterday. Anyways, this week was interesting, and this new
            week will be full of new changes. I´m excited though, should be a good
            experience. <br>I love you guys, let me know if you have any questions.
               <br><br> Love,<br>
                  Elder Bagley

                      <p>Today was kinda useless. Well, it started out well. We had our district and zone meetings. It was cool because the bishop came and helped teach how to work with the members and how to use ward council. I kept leaning over to Elder Edmonds saying how cool my bishop is. The zone leaders brought food, so that was cool. Also, now the senior comp is required to have the phone with them, because some people (Hernandez) are using the phone too much. After lunch we had the baptism for Heather Orellana, a little girl in the ward. It was good, I got to meet Elder and Sister Westover, one of the temple missionary couples. Cool to speak english. After that the day was worthless. There was a birthday party with Heather cause it was her birthday too. Well, 5-10 min isn't too bad, but an hour and a half is way to much time for a missionary to be there. I wanted to leave, but they always just say that's how they work in this ward. It's good to work with members, but that doesn't include parties. Later I went with Gubler to the house cause he was sick, while Hernandez and Lopez went to Marcelo's to eat. Boring. What made things worse was Hernandez and Lopez were supposed to go teach Braulio and Cristian, but they "didn't have time" for our most important investigators. They are supposed to be baptized Friday, so they should be our #1 priority always. Me, Lopez, and kind of Hernandez (he just backs up what Lopez says) had a talk on how to improve and stuff. Wasteful day, but oh well.</p>

                    <p>8 months!!! 1/3 of the way down. 8 months is actually a long time. Today, we started by doing nothing. Hernandez said Pres Dyer gave him 2 days to relax (even though that was a week ago) so he used 1 today. I organized my stuff, studied, then slept, while Hernandez slept. We went to Quillacollo to let Hernandez take out money, which he couldn't. At 6pm we visisted Jacqueline. She's tough cause all she wants is the Christian church to be true, so she won't do much. Hernandez was harsh with her. Later we basically entered the jungle and taught Rosimar. She's tentative for baptism, but she'll get there. Not sure what the hold up is, but we'll figure it out. Finally we visisted Braulio and Cristian Huarayo. Cristian got his answer, but Braulio not yet. We were really pushing for Friday, but I don't know if we'll get it. They'll get baptized, it just depends on when. We had pizza for dinner, so that's awesome. Sometimes I want to push my comp off the 4th story balcony, but I can't and shouldn't. "Paciencia" is what everyone tells me, but that's hard sometimes.</p>

                    <h3>February 20, 2014</h3>
                    <p>It rained a lot last night. When it rains a lot, water drips from the ceiling and lands on my bed. The rain woke me up and I had to move my bed. It was hard to get up in the morning. I need to get better. Everything was good in the morning. We had planning, and a good enough companionship inventory. After lunch we went to Quillacollo. We can't leave the area without permission, but Hernandez con z told me we did, so we went. It was to take out money from his bank account. Leaving we saw Elder Guillen (former assistant) and Elder Zenteno (sec of tramites). Well, they called the ZLs and found out we didn't have permission (I didn't know). We ended up having to talk to the secretaries, ZLs, and DL for being there. We taught one "lesson", just to a Cholita that thought I wanted to take her to the USA. We took a big bag of food to Flia Sanchez, and I carried it the whole way, it was heavy. We went back to Quillacollo later to buy refreshments for a ward missionary meeting. We had permission for sure this time. Finally we got to our meeting and... only 2 people were there. Oh well, better than nothing. Not sure why, but Hernandez got mad at me. I really couldn't figure out why. Later he got mad at Gubler, but that's kinda a permanent thing. Not much else to say, Go Jazz.</p>

                    <h3>February 21, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Today started out bad, but it was pretty good at the end. We got up and everything was good. After studying though my body just hurt all over. I went to sleep cause I literally had no energy. I woke up later and it was all good. We had good lessons today. We taught Flia Quispe about the temple and the husband hasn't drank for a while. Later we taught circus performers. No really. We found this lady in the circus is a member and her future husband is interested. Well, we taught them and he seems interested. Later we taught the Flia Riveros. They are going through a rough time and need help. I met Hernan Leon. He's a cool little guy that has a testimony. A little weird, but cool. Finally we taught Cristian and Braulio about the word of wisdom. Funniest part was meeting a drunk guy. We were walking to a house and he stopped us. Started saying how he was the most successful Bolivian in history and wrote a book "la verdadera fe". We got away from him, but like 10 minutes later he stopped us again and said basically the same thing. After Hernandez wanted hand sanitizer to wash the residue off his hand. He's a woman sometimes. We are polar opposites. He likes anime, has 4 cats, 7 dogs, likes Lady Gaga, Brittany Spears, etc... Idon't. We might have found a house for the Flia Chavez, so we are happy for that. Gubler is gonna baptize his first person tomorrow and is nervously practicing saying the ordinance and whatnot, kinda funny. Good day, or good enough for me.<br><br></p>

                    <h3>February 22, 2014</h3>
                    <p>I really don't like when I have to join a few days together in my journal instead of writing them seperately, but usually I do it when important things happen. Well, Saturday was an interesting day. In the morning we went with the Flia Chavez to look at ta house for them. It was a nice house, but there is a single man living in the house, so they can't live there and put their daughters in danger. We also helped push a car out of the mud. I really hope the Flia Chavez finds a house, they're a great family and they deserve it. Later we went to an appointment with Circus Performers. I'm still not sure on the names, but they're awesome. Really interested and all that. Later we went to a baptism. It was Gubler's first baptism, but he did it really well, didn't make a mistake. After that we went to a BBQ at Jorge's mom's house. We met his brother and his brother's family. They're from Santa Cruz, actually the wife was a pensionista of Elder Gygi, a kid who roomed with me in the CCM. It was a good night, but at the end Hernandez was mad at me. Couldn't figure out why. Finally he told me... 1) I went away to talk to  talk with Gubler cause Gubler wanted help. I forget to tell Hernandez though. So ya, that one's my fault. 2) I wouldn't give him the phone to talk to his friend Elder Garcia. Obeying the rules gets me in trouble apparently. Well we had a big long talk and after lots of talking, we more or less figured things out. Even better was what Elder Gubler did. He sucked up all his pride and said sorry to Lopez and Hernandez. He basically fixed everything in the house, all the problems. Well, Hernandez still has a way to go, but he is slowly progressing. Gubler was crying and helped so much. We all went to bed at like 1 though.</p>

                    <p>Sunday we got up, and although very tired, went out to pick people up. We went on splits. I went with Denis, this guy in the ward. He's pretty cool. We had the circus guy and Hernan at church, so that was good. After church we ate lunch with the Flia Cuba, and then went home and crashed. At night we went to the hospital because Lopez's old pensionista is there with cancer. Not sure why me and Hernandez went, but oh well. WE had dinner with the Flia Vaca. Finally, it was time for cambios. Actually, Lopez and Hernandez faked the cambios once each, but eventually we got them. I am staying here, my new comp will be Elder Muñoz, and I'm going to be DL! I'm so scared of that. It's a whole new responsibility, and I'm gonna need a lot of help. Hernandez is leaving, and questioning all the motives of Pres Dyer and stuff. Kinda bitter actually. Lopez is going to Potosi. Sad to leave, but not bitter. Overall, interesting cambios, but I feel like these next 6 weeks will be very productive.</p>

                    <p>P-day, the last one with Hernandez. I decided it's his day, so I'd just follow him around. Well, in the morning we did nothing. We went to internet, which was slow. Found out that girlfriend I had before the mission might be engaged... so that's new. I'm not sad, bothered, or anything like that, just wondering why no one told me. Later we went to Luigi's, where I met up with Elder Harwood for the first time since the CCM. I ate with him and Elder Christiansen, like a mini reunion. Later we ended up going to the Cancha, where I bought some Bayern Munich pants. At night we went around visiting people so Hernandez could say bye. He took it hard, but that's what it's like to leave an area. We got home and Hernandez just told me everything I needed to do. He worries a lot, but I've got it covered. Cambios tomorrow, it'll be interesting to get a new comp.</p>
