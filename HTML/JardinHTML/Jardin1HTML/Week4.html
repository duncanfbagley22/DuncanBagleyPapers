            <h1>Week 4 <small>(February 17, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Como me gusta la noche</h3>
            <p><small>Family and others<br>
                This week was full of everything. Homecomings, temple, someone
             wanting to go home, parties, weddings, future baptisms, and much more.
             Interesting right? Well here´s what happened...<br>
             Monday- We went to the Cristo statue. It is the most uphill hike ever,
             like my calves hurt for 4 days after. The view was awesome at the top
             though. I hung out with Elder Vasquez (was with me in the MTC) and
             Elder Edmonds (from Salt Lake). It was actually fun though. We ended
             up seeing some of the olympics while eating lunch too.<br>
             Tuesday- Not sure what happened in the day, but we went to the airport
             at night to see a missionary get home. Elder Tudela went to Chile
             Concepcion/Rancagua (he knows Brian Woodbury and David Archuleta).
             Talk about tronki. Seeing someone else get home, hug their family, is
             hard. But then I realized it´ll be hard to leave the mission too.<br>
             Wednesday- we planned a temple trip with the ward, and had a lot of
             success. We had a bus and a van full of people from our area. 4
             Investigators, 3 recent converts, like 3 families of less actives. It
             was great. Me and Elder Lopez taught everyone a special temple lesson
             in the visitors center. However, there was an interesting turn of
             events. We were loading up the bus, and were still waiting for people
             to show up. Some of the people on the bus were complaining that we
             werent going, along with the other missionaries calling telling us to
             get there, we just sent the bus alone, and waited and went with the
             other people in a van. Well, turns out that Elder Hernandez thought
             the bus driver was drunk (I saw no evidence) and apparently he called
             the WML to tell him that. The WML got mad, if we really sent people
             with a drunk driver that would be, and Hernandez got offended by that.
             The WML called the company, the manager came down and slapped the
             driver in the face for being drunk. However, he wasnt drunk (I know
             what drunk people look like, he wasnt one). Because of that, the WML
             got mad at Hernandez, and Hernandez just lost it. He started crying
             and told me he didnt wanna be here on the mission anymore. Well, he
             wanted to call President Dyer, but I wouldnt let him. I told him we´d
             go on a walk, and then he could decide. We walked, talked, and ironed
             things out. However, we did call president just for a helpful
             interview. It was an uncomfortable night however.<br>
             Thursday- We went to the interview. It helped a lot, not sure what
             they said inside, but Hernandez is a little better now. Sounds like
             most likely he is leaving this cambio. We also talked to the bishop
             that night, and he is a stud. Does everything he can to help us.
             Friday- Not sure, I think just a normal day.<br>
             Saturday- We went to a baptism of some other elders, and the WML´s
             sister-in-law´s wedding. Other than that, normal<br>
             Sunday- Got some people to church, and then at night we had an
             activity in the ward. All the return missionaries brought things from
             their missions and we talked about it and stuff. Definitely something
             that we should do in the ward at home.
             <br><br>
             As far as investigators, we have 2 set baptisms this week. Braulio and
             Cristian Huarayo. I met them my first day here, and they have
             progressed well. Braulio is 16 and Cristian is 13. They are immature
             at times, but sometimes we have good spiritual moments with them and
             they have a desire to be baptized. Baptism is on Friday. Hernandez is
             still trying to run the show here, and we havent really found new
             people. I am slowly trying to work my way into getting some work done,
             and eventually there´ll be lots of success. The elders I live with are
             me, Hernandez, Elder Lopez and Elder Gubler. Me and Lopez are relaxed
             guys and just dont wanna cause problems. Gubler and Hernandez are very
             stubborn and they dont get along, so there are problems there. Next
             Sunday is cambios, and itll be interesting to see what happens. I am
             going to have 8 months this week. We were helping some future
             missionaries with their papers, and it was weird to think I did mine
             about 14 months ago. The time goes really fast. I really do like it
             here in El Paso. It is cool to have a different experience than in
             Sucre. Found out Elder Lopez, my trainer, got his visa, and is going
             to leave soon, so that stinks. Not much else to say. I love the
             mission.<br><br>
                Les amo mucho,<br>
                   Elder Bagley<br><br>
             P.S I learned my numbers in Quechua<br>
             1- Uk<br>
             2- Iskay<br>
             3- Kimsa<br>
             4- Tawa<br>
             5- Phischa<br>
             6- Suqta<br>
             7- Qanchis<br>
             8- Pusaj<br>
             9- Jisq´un<br>
             10- Chunka<br>
             P.S.S<br>
             The title is the name of a song, but it is true cause I am tired at
             the end of every day, and I love sleeping. Also, more success happens
             at night</small></p>

                      <p>Well this morning was awkward. Me and Hernandez didn't talk until about 11 or 12. Still not sure why he was mad, but he wouldn't even say a word. He told Lopez, while I was sitting next to Lopez, to tell me he was going to sleep. We finally got everything ironed out now and we're going good. We had a zone meeting today. WE started at 10, with only me, Hernandez, and the zone leaders there. We also had Hno Jorge come to the meeting and give ideas for how to work with members. We went home after lunch to study. That's where we ironed everything out. We didn't really accomplish anything, just 1 lesson. At night, we went to the airport to welcome some elder home to the ward. It made me tronki looking at someone hugging their family after the mission, but at the same made me realize how hard it will be to leave. At night, nothing else really happened, except Hernandez flipped out at Gubler for something, couldn't figure out what, but he basically hates him. I just wanna work, but stuff keeps holding me back, gotta push through.</p>

                    <h3>February 12, 2014</h3>
                    <p>This is turning out to be just an interesting turn of events. Today was, wooowee... It started well. We taught a few lessons to less actives to get them to come to the temple. We basically walked around all day inviting people to the temple. At 5:30 we started rounding people up to go to the temple. We got a bus to come, and people starting in. We were supposed to leave at 6:40, but when it was time to go we still had lots of investigators who weren't there, but people were complaining, so we just sent them in the bus, while we waited for everyone else. The Flia Chavez and Huarayo finally showed up and we went in a trufi. There's an interesting backstory though. When the bus driver got to the Main Plaza, Hernandez leaned to 
                     me and said something like "I think he's been drinking". This is the part of the story where I guess I might have some blame. I could've tried to be 100% he wasn't drunk, but from what I saw he had no disability to keep him from driving. When we sent them on their way, Hernandez called Lopez and said "Why did they contract a guy that was ?" I don't remember the word, but I thought is meant stupid or not very smart, however it meant drunk. Long story short, Lopez told Jorge, Jorge called the bus agency boss, and the boss showed up, slapped the driver (in front of his family) for being drunk. Turns out, the guy wasn't drunk. Not even close. Maybe a bit odd, but not drunk. Jorge flipped out at Hernandez on the phone for that, and that maybe Hernandez mad. At the temple, he got so mad/frustrated he said he wanted to go home. I said he couldn't, and I took him on a walk to make things better. He calmed down, and was more reasonable, but I called Pres Dyer, so we're gonna tlak with him to see what he can do to help. That part of my life is stressful right now. There were good things though. All the recent converts came to the temple, 4 investigators, a bunch of less actives, and others from El Paso. We have probably 40 +/-. Also, apparently we have a baptism saturday. Rosimar Rodriguez Condori showed up (she was taught before) and wants to be baptized. So that's good. I wanna help Hernandez, but he doesn't want help. It's a tough situation, but it'll be figured out tomorrow.

                    <h3>February 13, 2014</h3>
                    <p>(Generic comment about the day). The morning was boring. We had our daily planning as well as our weekly planning. Nothing special. We ate lunch with the Flia. Chavez, cause it was the dad's birthday. It was fun, they're a cool family. The grandma was there too and she was super funny. Just a whitty old lady. Then we went to Hernandez's interview with President. I just kinda sat there in the waiting room. Hernandez left the interview happier. According to what Pres. told him, he's leaving this cambio. We'll find out I guess. On the way back, we met a kid named Johjan, because he sat next to Hernandez on the trufi. He read the Liahona while Hernandez did and was interested. We walked with him all the way home, he's a stud. We taught Brualio and Cristian. We have baptismal dates for them. We had a meeting with the bishop later, then basically finished the night. Overall, a better ending than last night.

                    <p>Woo, valentine's day. Doesn't really mean anything as a missionary in Bolivia, but still counts. Today was good enough. We started by listening to Elder Lopez's backstory. He was a bad kid growing up, like threw rocks at the police, went to jail, and such. He's seen people get shot. The mission can really change someone. We met a new family today, Flia Menacho. They are a family of 5, and are pretty cool. Might take some time to get them going, but they could eventually progress. We also tried to cross a river to get to another part of the area. We built a rock bridge about halfway, but it was too deep, so we couldn't get there. That's probably how the Sons of Mosiah did it; exploring and what not. We also taught Braulio and Cristian Huarayo. I feel like they'll get baptized, they've got the desire. We also made chuño... Me and Hernandez had a talk about cambios and what it is like to leave an area. I think I made him appreciate the area more. Not a bad day, and we finally got home on time.

                    <p>Today just kinda flew by. We went to a marriage in the morning. Jorge's sister-in-law and her husband. It was kinda boring, but there was free food. Later we went to a baptism of Elder Edmonds and Elder Cruz. We went to lunch at a member's house, nothing too special, but it was good. We then gave a blessing to the member's sister. Gubler wanted to do the annointing in english, but I smacked him and made him do it in spanish. We had a lesson with the Flia Condori. The little girls are awesome, and the parents are slowly progressing. We were going to go to the wedding party, but it wasn't where we thought, and we ended up just walking around for nothing. We went back to the house to "study" the four of us. Usually that just means Gubler and I study, while Lopez and Hernandez sleep. I studied, then watched a movie about Spencer W Kimball. It was good to learn more about him. We then had a lesson with Mayra (Maira). At first, I never thought she'd progress, but she could eventually get going. She said she'll come to church tomorrow, so we'll see. After that, just dinner and then home. Really just a quick day overall.</p>

                    <p>Well, Sunday. Always tired on Sunday. We went to pick up investigators and what not. WE loaded up the trufi and got to church. I think we did well, we are gonna rent a bus now cause we have too many people. Church was good, just normal. Jorge's daughted dropped my phone is a drain, so that was fun. We ate lunch with the bishop and his family. They're cool, good family. At night we had an awesome activity. We had a ward mission night, where all the return missionaries brought stuff to show and there were some talks. It was a cool activity, something I definitely wanna do in the states. Other than that, just not too exciting, ready for p-day.</p>

                    <p>P-day. Full of athletic activities. We did internet and whatnot, then we went to the chapel (oh ya, my dad is going to South Africa next week or something). We played soccer at the church, and it was pretty fun. I did well enough. We went to lunch at Luigi's. I ate with Elder Phillips and Elder Grover. It was good to talk to Grover, cause his comp is like mine, actually they're best friends. Then we went to the stake center in Cocha, where we played basketball. 5 on 5, full court, with Phillips, Christiansen, Crankshaw, and a bunch of others. It was way fun, makes me miss playing with my friends at home. We were supposed to leave at 5, but left at 6 cause my comp was late coming back from a store. We taught Braulio and Cristian. I'm not sure they are ready for baptism, but Hernandez is pushing it real hard. I'm scared that we'll do it too early, but we'll see. Life is still up and down with Hernandez. 1-7 weeks left, hope I can do it.</p>
