            <h1>Week 1 <small>(January 27, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Ch ch ch changes (sung like David Bowie´s song)</h3>
            <p><small>Family and others that probably wish they were Bagleys<br>
                Well, interesting title huh? Well, I will get to explaining it.
             Last Monday was eh... Las Palmas are hot and there wasnt much to do.
             Tuesday was good, found some more investigators and what not.
             Wednesday we had a really good lesson with Dina, where the spirit was
             strong and I felt really good about it. At night, we were talking to
             Hna Estela (owner of our house) and I got a phone call from the Zone
             Leaders (dramatic music). There they told me that I had an emergency
             cambio and I was headed to Cochabamba Friday morning to a place called
             El Paso. Shocking aint it? Well, that meant that Thursday was just the
             craziest day ever. We ran around doing everything to get ready, and
             having to say goodbye to people. First we went to the Flia Plaza. It
             was really hard to say bye, cause I love them so much. But... the ward
             travels to the temple in July, so I should be able to see everyone
             then. Then we went and visited Hno Freddy, and his family, and Oliver.
             That one was hard. I almost cried at the end, but I held it in.
             However, definitely had one of the top ten saddest moments in the
             history of the world (go grab a tissue if you might cry). I was
             talking to Oliver and he asked where I was going. He already knew I
             was leaving, just not exactly the location. I told him cochabamba, and
             then he grabbed my hand, put it to his face, and said "no te vayas" or
             "dont go". Whew, that was hard. I am almost crying talking about it.
             At night, also the following morning, we talked to Hna Sandra, Maria,
             Hector, and Dennys. Hector and Dennys werent too happy about me going,
             but they will probably come to the temple, and I can see them there.
             At night also we talked to some more members in the ward, Hna Estela
             and her family, Hna Magdelina, Hna Madeline, and Ivana. Freak, I met
             so many cool people in Sucre that I have to go back and see them no
             matter what. I got a lot of presents too, lots of chocolate, a scarf,
             some souvenir things. I definitely made a good impact. Well, Friday I
             had my flight. It got postponed like 3 times, but I finally got here
             (it is like a 25 minute flight). My area is called El Paso. It is a
             little pueblo on the outskirts of the city. It has a cool little
             colonial feel to it though, so I really like it. My comp is Elder
             Hernandez from El Salvador. He is a great missionary. He only has 3
             months, and half was spent in the hospital with his comp, but he is
             here for the right reasons. He is a little different, and has a hard
             time getting along with some of the other missionaries (not me, we´re
             fine), but we are working on it. He is a convert of 2 years, and only
             18 years old. His family basically disowned him for joining the
             church, but he doesnt really care cause he knows it is true. He is
             basically one of those kinds of stories from the Liahona. My ward is
             like the best one in the whole mission apparently. It is focused on
             missionary work. In the last 3 months, there has been 14 baptisms in
             the ward. The bishop is on our side and wants to help in everything.
             The ward mission leader is the coolest guy ever. He wants to give us a
             car but it is against mission rules. He was an AP on his mission for
             16 months. My pensionista used to be President Dyer´s pensionista, and
             she has cooked for a bunch of important people, even Elder Holland.
             Basically, I am really sad for leaving Sucre, but I am excited for
             this ward. This is a big week of changes, but I am sure it is good.
             <br>Love you guys, and I am sure next week will have a lot of interesting
             stories from the first real week in El Paso.<br><br> Love you guys.<br>
                Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <p>Flight was good. I got to the airport in Cocha and met my new comp, Elder Hernandez from El Salvador. He's... a little different. He' 18, and acts old, or tries to, but he's actually kinda immature. I have heard a lot about this ward, that it is awesome, it works hard, and all that. My comp is gonna require, some paciencia (no sé ingles), but I think we'll get some work done. The area is different than Sucre, really different. Flat, green, poorer. We haven't really accomplished much yet, but we'll get there. The pensionista is awesome. She was the pensionista for Pres Dyer before, and has cooked for apostles and all that. The other elders we live with are Elder Lopez, a guy from Ecuador, super funny, and Elder Gubler, a gringo from Southern Utah that doesn't speak much spanish. Nothing much else to say. I'm excited to be in this area, and I know I'll find success. I miss Sucre, but I gotta do what the Lord wants.</p>

                    <p>This is gonna be a shorter entry. We woke up to help clean the church for a baptism Lopez had. I already like the other 2 elders. We ate lunch, which was good, even though it took 2 1/2 hours cause the food came slow. We taught 1 lesson, then went to the baptism. The whole zone came, so that's good. It's really united. We came home, and Hernandez complained a bit. He likes to focus on the faults of others, but not his. He's young, so I'm trying to help him. Welp, peace out. Nothin else to say.</p>

                    <h3>January 26, 2014</h3>
                    <p>My first Sunday. It is weird to be in somewhere other than Churuquella, but I'll get used to it I'm sure. We have to take a 30min trufi ride to get there, but it all works out. The ward is a lot bigger than Churuquella too. Like 50% bigger. I felt really out of place, but I'm getting used to it. The ward is great. The members work with the missionaries, the bishop is really concerned about the work of salvation, and the ward mission leader is incredible. The ward mission leader, Jorge, is known around the mission. He owns a car sale business, and would give the missionaries a car if it was allowed. I think this ward will find success for sure. AFter church we ate with members, and it wasn't awful, just about the same as Sucre. We went home and had a problem with Hernandez. He gets mad really easily and really fast, so when Elder Gubler touches his stuff, he loses it. He had to take a cool down nap while I studied. We talked in the street a lot about it. I'm just trying to help him, but he's very closed minded. I'm just trying to be the older brother though. I get along with him, but others not so much. We (I) met a cool family later, played the piano for a bit, then we just came home. I talked with Elder Lopez at night, just talking about how to help Hernandez. Right now I'm just outside on our patio enjoying some peacefulness of the outdoors. I'm so glad God blessed me with this area. I know it's where I'm supposed to be.</p>

                    <h3>January 27, 2014</h3>
                    <p>My first real p-day in Cochabamba. We did internet, which was good. I definitely surprised everyone by being in Cocha. We went to Luigi's, which is basically a food court. There I saw a bunch of my friends, Elder Long, Christiansen, Cedano, Montaño... it was like a big reunion. Later we just kinda walked around. We were gonna cook something with others, but that fell through. I did get to see people like Elder Medina and Elder Delgadillo, friends from my first cambio. We had an FHE with the Primary President and her husband, the high priest group leader. It was good, they're cool people, he works in the temple. This Hernandez kid is gonna test my pacience. He's just different than my other compes. He's not an easy to get along with person. We I try to talk serious he laughs, and he is always making excuses. He just needs to grow up a little. It'll stretch me a little, but we'll get there. I'm here for a reason as we all know. Anyways, it's time to work this week.</p>
