            <h1>Week 7 <small>(March 10, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Carnaval</h3>
            <p><small>Dearest family,<br>
                This week was relatively interesting, and boring, and exciting, and
             basically everything in between. I can never decide how to write my
             letter, and you`d think I would figure it out after almost 9 months as
             a missionary, but still not sure. This week, I will go back to a day
             by day thing.<br>
             Monday- P-day, kinda. Because of Carnaval, we had to be in our houses
             at 4 Monday and Tuesday, so we had a shorter p day. We had to stay
             around Quillacollo, cause the center of Cocha had a bunch of parties.
             We ended up playing soccer and that was fun. Then just stayed home for
             the night. We were just hanging out up on the balcony, throwing water
             balloons at people, when the house got stormed by this kid that lives
             a floor below us, him and his friends. Well, they drenched me in
             water, but Muñoz and Gubler hid. I made the people a deal, if they
             gave us their names and addresses and agreed to let us visit them,
             they could soak Muñoz and Gubler (it was bound to happen anyways).
             Well, we have 2 new contacts because of that.<br>
             Tuesday- We had our district meeting. The temporary name of the
             district is ``Distrito Tiras-y``. Tiras is a Sucre word, and it
             basically means ugly, bad, stupid, or just not good. For some reason,
             in Sucre and Potosi, older people end like every sentence by saying
             ``y?``. Hence, Tiras y? I taught on finding new people. I still dont
             like teaching classes, but I am getting better. After, we went to the
             offices because Muñoz lost his wallet a few weeks ago, so he needed to
             get his recommend renewed. Then we went home, and rearranged our room.
             We have so much more room now, it`s awesome.<br>
             Wednesday-Thursday- We really focused on finding new people. We found
             Sayra, who knew about the church before in Potosi, and was thinking
             about going back. Also Marisol, this lady who is full of problems, but
             was really thankful that we showed up. Finally, Aydde. She was just in
             the street, working with a broken computer, and we started talking to
             her. We talked for a bit, and then set an appointment for saturday.<br>
             Friday- It was Carnaval part 2. There were people dancing in the
             street and it was a bit crazy. We worked in the morning, so we went
             back home to study. We got home, and it rained soooooo hard. We
             couldnt see anything outside, the patio flooded, and water started
             coming into the room. Like an inch of water in 5 minutes of rain.
             Luckily we were home to save the room from being more flooded. The
             power went out too, and when I got here, Elder Lopez told me El Paso
             is super dangerous when there is no power, and that we have to stay
             home. So, we stayed home at night.<br>
             Saturday- We ate lunch at an awesome house. It is like a cabin, set in
             Bolivia. Only $200,000, so I told Muñoz that we are going to buy it
             after our missions. Then we went back and taught Aydde, along with her
             brother Gabriel. We had troubles finding the house (there arent any
             street names here), but after like 30 minutes, we found it. They are
             awesome. They are really interested, ask great questions, and even
             came to stake conference yesterday. We are hoping to keep them
             progressing as fast as possible. At night there was some special stake
             meeting we had to go to in Quillacollo.<br>
             Sunday- We had stake conference. It was a regional Bolivian
             conference. Elder Pino from the 70, Elder Rasband, Sister Reeves and
             Elder Nelson spoke from La Paz. Sister Reeves and Elder Nelson even
             did it all in spanish, so that was cool. We rented a bus to go from El
             Paso, and we filled it. Literally everyone I know from El Paso came,
             basically cause we talked to them so much about, bugged them about it,
             gave out invitations and everything. There were almost 2000 people at
             stake conference, so hopefully that left a good impression with our
             investigators we had there. Even the bus driver came for a bit. Then
             we ate with the Bishop, talked with him, then had another special
             meeting about ward council. On the way back, we had to push another
             bishop`s car to a gas station as well.<br>
             This was a tiring week, but we felt good about our work. Working with
             Muñoz is really fun, and we get a lot more done than before. Today we
             are going to play paintball as a zone, so that should be fun. I love
             you guys, be good, and I`ll talk to you next week.<br><br>
                 Love,<br>
                   Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <p>P-day #2, basically. We obviously didn't do much today, but it was because we weren't allowed to. We had our meetings in the morning, meaning I had to teach again. We gave the district a preliminary name, Distrito Tiras-y. Other good ones I've heard of are Distrito Korihor (Cedano), Gadianton (Lopez Camba), and qué te importa (Lopez Ecuador). I talked about finding new investigators. I hope my lessons aren't too boring, I'm trying my best. We went to lunch, where I decided not to speak english with Gubler, and Eilin got bit more or less by a dog. Later, we went to Muñoz's interview with Pres. We couldn't really find trufis, but we got there. We hung around there, I talked to Harwood, Robertson, Vasquez, and Gallegos. Then we went home. Basically, we threw more balloons, reorganized our room, and that was it. A good day, good bye to Carnaval til next year.</p>

                    <p>Back to real life. Today was pretty good. We studied, and all that, but we also looked at old investigators. Well now we have 45 more places to visit. After lunch, we ended up talking to this lady that works at a nusery. She went to the church before in Potosi and is really cool. We'll have an appt later this week. We decided to talk to more people today, and it worked out well. We went and talked to Hna Chavez, then went looking for old investigators. We found Basilio, this guy with crutches. He was cool, but didn't seem very interested and there were a lot of flies there. We also helped Hna Vasquez carry heavy bags of corn. Later we found a girl named Aidde (?) sitting repairing a machine. She was awesome, paid attention, and hopefully will progress. Later we taught Hernan and his brother Rimberto. We taught the gospel of JEsus Christ, and invited him to be baptized. Hopefully all goes well. Overall, a tiring day, but a good one. We need to work like that every day.</p>

                    <p>Well, I can't really remember what happened today. Here's a list of what happened:<br>- We talked to Edson from the circus for the first time in a while. He didn't even remember about when we came and he was drunk. We taught the Word of Wisdom, and hopefully he remembers it. We are never sure with them, whether they'll move or not, but they are still doing well.<br>- We used our Area Book looking for people. We couldn't find anyone home (we did find a crying dog, that was scared of us and it was really awkward). We did end up running into a lady named Marisol. She likes to tlak, but is going through a rough time and said we came at the right moment. Hopefully it all work out.<br>- We talked to Braulio and Cristian. If we can get permission for their baptism from their sister, we'll be good on everything.<br>- Waited for Jorge forever in the chapel. We were kinda cranky, but it was good, he helped us out a lot.<br>Other than that, nothing major. Enjoying life for what it's worth.</p>

                    <p>Wow, today ended weirdly. We woke up, studied, then went to give a baptismal interview. It was with an investigator of the ZL's, named Ana Paula. She was pretty cool, understood the things we talked about, and is ready for baptism. Later we found a new investigator named Mery. We were looking for a different house but ran into her. She's cool, and seemed kinda interested. After lunch, we visited Flia Quispe, then went to the house to study. We got there and they were having big Carnaval parties in the street. However, it started raining, like really hard. It basically flooded the patio and water came into the house. We had to clean everything after and get water out. It hailed even. The rained for about 10min, but probably an inch. It was crazy, and cut the power for the whole town. We couldn't leave because we couldn't see anything. We ended up visiting Flia Alarcon and that was it. Not a very eventful day, but good enough.<br><br><br></p>

                    <p>Today was a good day. We studied in the morning, and it was more productive than normal. Muñoz is a stud, I love working with him. For lunch we ate at this cool cabin house that was huge. I told Muñoz we should buy it in 20 yrs. Later we went looking for Aydde's house. We contacted her in the street on Thursday, but this morning we couldn't find her house for like 45min. We got there finally, and also met her brother Gabriel. It was a great lesson. We talked for a bit, and Gabriel wanted to know why the churches fight. We taught the Restauracion, and there was a great spirit. We I told the first vision, I definitely felt the spirit. They'll hopefully be great investigators. We then went around inviting every living thing to church. Leaving notes and what not. We visited with Hernan for a bit, and then we had a little conference in the stake. They talked about the work of Salvation and stuff. It was good, but a little boring. We left and got home late, but ready to fill the bus tomorrow. Bedtime.</p>

                    <p>Domingo. We had some good success. We went around the area waking everyone up, doing everything we could do to get people to church. Well, we did end up filling the bus. I think we hit 32 people in the bus, so we were happy. The conference was good. It was a satelitte transmission from La Paz. A special conference with Elder Pino, Elder Rasband, Sister Reeves, and Elder Nelson spoke. It was cool, because Sister Reeves and Elder Nelson spoke in spanish. The conference was good. Almost 2000 people there. Hopefully it made a good impression on the investigators. We had Gabriel, Aydde, Hernan, Cristian, and even the bus driver came for a bit. We were happy. We had lunch with the bishop. Apaza and Gubler cancelled a few minutes before, so the bishop's wife was mad. Well, we didn't have time to go home, so we hung out with the bishop, and then we went to another meeting. It was about ward council and stuff. Hna Alford tried to give waska to the Stake President, so that was awkward. On the way home, we pushed Bishop Davila's car to a gas station, so that was fun. Good day, full of good success with the church and all that. However, p-day tomorrow, Dia de Reposo.</p>

                    <p>This was a quick p-day. We went to internet, just normal. Freak, not even Pres Dyer wrote me today. After internet, we went to play paintball. It was fun, and awful, at the same time. For being in Bolivia, it was actually good quality. We played with the whole zone, except 2 hermanas. We played 3 games. The first one, I was kinda a whimp, didn't know what I was doing. I didn't get killed, but we lost. The second game we won so fast I couldn't do anything. The third, I was all ready to go, no fear, but... my gun wouldn't fire. Oh well, I've learned, so next time I'll do better. After that, we went to Luigi's then to the Quillacollo market with Edmonds and Cruz. They're like my best friends in the zone, they're awesome. At night, and FHE with the Flia Riveros. They're good, just lazy at times and the grandma worries too much. I also was able to dedicate a house, so that was cool. A quick day, ready for a new week.</p>
