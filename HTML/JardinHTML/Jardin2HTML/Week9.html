            <h1>Week 9 <small>(March 24, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Happy Birthday Rachel!!!!!!!</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
                Well, if the title didnt explain enough, HAPPY BIRTHDAY RACHEL,
            FELIZ CUMPLEAÑOS!!!!!!!!! Hope you have a great day and it is filled
            with happiness and happy things and candy.<br>
               Anyways, this was a good week. It had its ups and downs, but it was
            good enough. I will just list the cool and other interesting things
            that happened.<br>
            - we went bowling for p day. It was fun, I am decent, but I was a lot
            better in college.<br>
            - Thursday we had to go to the city to try to be legal with tramites
            (spanish word) and all that. I got to see Elder Harris from Sucre, so
            that was cool. Being on the outside of the city makes it so that when
            I go to Cocha I think it is probably the richest, nicest city in the
            world. It is gonna be weird to come back to the states<br>
            - Intercambio, I went with Elder Tiahin from Beni, Bolivia, on an
            intercambio in El Paso. It was cool, I learned a lot, and it made
            Tiahin, ZL, realize that El Paso is a hard area and we are doing well
            working there.<br>
            - Dia del Mar, yesterday and today are the celebration for the day
            when Bolivia lost its ocean to Chile. They are still pretty obsessed
            with it.<br>
            - Investigators, here is what is happening with the important investigators<br>
            1) Javier Soliz- he was doing well, but we couldnt get a hold of him
            this week cause he was working. We will go by this week<br>
            2)Aydde y Gabriel- The werent home at all this week<br>
            3) Flia Nuñez- Franco, Rodrigo, Cristian, and Rosella. They are
            grandkids of a member (at least, we think, but she told us yesterday
            she was never confirmed, so we will work on that). Franco is 8, but
            likes the BoM, and comes to church all the time. The other three have
            all come to church, but they will require some work<br>
            4) Karen, Braulio, Cristian, Flia Flores, and others are requiring
            more work, but they`ll get there eventually<br>
            5) We met a lady named Ana Paula with Elder Tiahin. She is old, but an
            amazing example of faith. Usually I dont say cheesy things like that,
            but it was true, so it had to be done<br>
            -Venezuela. All the Venezuela missions are getting shut down cause it
            is crazy there right now. I found out Elder Lopez got reassigned to
            Osorno Chile, and just happened to meet an Elder Thomas Crozter. Small
            world<br>
            Other than that, just a normal week. We have interviews with President
            this week, a zone conference, President is gonna come to my District
            class, and I have to go back to the city to do tramites. Should be an
            interesting week. Hope you all are doing well. I hit 9 months last
            week, so I am basically old now. Love you all, keep me and bolivia in
            your prayers.<br><br>
            Q´ayacama<br>

                      <p>Quick day. We got up and went to the district meeting. I really don't like teaching the classes. It's hard to teach for an hour and a half. I got through it well enough though. I never want to be zone leader. We were talking as a zone about what we were gonna do for p-day. Everyone just complains about not getting their way and stuff, they're like little kids. Anyways, after lunch we went looking for old investigators. We set a few appts and stuff like that. At the end, we found 2 people named Antonia and her daughter Esther. It's an older lady and her daughter. They actually seemed kinda interested. We have an appt on Thursday with them. Later we had a lesson with Javier Soliz, and Dennis, a ward missionary, came with us. It was a great lesson. Dennis helped out a lot, and I feel pretty certain that when we got back on Saturday, Javier will have read and prayed and received his answer. Other than that, still getting over my cold, so that is still annoying. Hopefully tomorrow will be a good day as well.</p>

                    <p>Woohoo, 9 months in the mission. The hermanas in my group are halfway done, that's pretty weird. I'm trying to remember what happened, but I basically remember 2 things. Number 1, we had a good lesson with a few new people. They are named Karin, Wiljem, and his daughter. They're cousins, and Karin used to listen to the missionaries. They seemed pretty interested. We are going to meet with them Friday and Saturday. Other than that, we (Muñoz and I) just had a nice long chat. Just to iron out any problems we have had. It was a long talk, but I think we understand better now. Welp, I'm tired, and we have to get up at 6 tomorrow to go to tramites, so that'll be fun.</p>

                    <p>Woohoo, tramites. Actually, it wasn't fun. We had to get up at 6 to get there. At the beginning I was just with Elder Jerrell talking about basketball, which made me a little tronki. Later, I talked through the rich part of Cocha, and I pretty much thought I was in the richest place on earth. I can't imagine rich places in the states. I also saw Elder Harris for the first time in a while, so that was cool. After, we rode a micro home, and my shoulders didn't even fit it was so small. After lunch, we went to work, but nothing really happened. We never have anything before 5 o'clock. However, we were walking and I had the impression to knock a door. It was a nice house, we the guy opened and even let us in. His name is Eric and he is awesome. He had met with missionaries before, but now seems prepared. Only problem, in a week he leaves for Chaparre to work for a few months. Oh well. We had our meeting with Coco (Jorge) later. We were at our house and I got mad at Muñoz cause he decided it was more important to eat bread than go to the meeting we were already late for. Oh well, again. I'm on an intercambio now, Elder Tiahin will be in Jardin for a day, so we'll see how this goes.</p>

                    <p>Intercambio day. Pressure is on when the ZL is in the house. It was actually a good day. Elder Tiahin, from BEni, was with me today. In the morning, we visited with Maribel (a less active) and her nonmember mom, Celestina. Their cool, know about everything, they just always make excuses to not go to church. We're gonna need help with that, but we'll get there. During lunch, Joel was really sick, so we had to give him a blessing. After lunch, we visited the Flia Riveros, found the sister Delicia, a less active, who I never knew existed. We also gave a blessing to Fabiana, making it my 2nd blessing I gave in just a few hours. The family is steadily progressing to be really active. After, we visited a lady named Ana Paula. At first, she just seemed like an old lady that wanted to talk, but she was great. I learned how to teach better in that lesson. We let her teach herself, by asking lots of questions. She is full of faith, which is awesome. She could really progress. Then we went to a baptism that Gubler and Apaza had, we had to wait an hour, but it finally started. Tiahin gained a lot of respect for El Paso. It's a difficult area, so we are doing a good job in it. The intercambio was a good experience, but good to be back with Muñoz.</p>

                    <p>Today was pretty good. We somehow got out weekly planning in, so that was good. WE had lunch with the bishop's family. I think the bishop likes me most out of everyone. After that, we did our regular saturday routine. All the appts fall through in the afternoon. We went with Hna Chavez to visit some people. First, the Flia Flores. They're Hna Chavez's family's friends, and are only a tiny bit interested. The mom's a cholita, so we had to teach very slowly. After that we visited Karen. She cool, we talked about baptism a little, and it was good. After that, we talked to the Flia Nuñez. We talked to Franco, 8 yrs old, and Rodrigo, 14 yrs old. Apparently, they liked church, so that's good. They're a family we are focused on right now, so we hope they progress. Other than that just had lunch. Normal day no más pues pero.</p>

                    <p>Woohoo, dia del Mar. Today is the day when Bolivian celebrate losing the ocean to Chile. Only in Bolivia would they celebrate a holiday where they lost. Today was good. We didi divisions in the morning in order to get people to church. I went with Israel Olmos, a kid preparing for his mission. WE tried to go to ward council, but there weren't trufis, so we were too late. Only one investigator at church, Franco, but there were 3 less actives. After church I literally ran out of money. 0bs. I felt powerless. We only had 1 lesson, with the Flia Nuñez. They just need a strong testimony, and then we'll be all ready to go. They also fed us after the lesson, and I got to hold a cool little tropical bird. Sundays are usually kinda boring, but it means the start of a new week. Hope it's a good one.</p>

                    <p>Happy Birthday Rachel Bagley. Today was just a regular p-day. We had internet, just normal. I found out that firstly, they've taken out all foreign missionaries from Venezuela, and second, because of that my trainer, Elder Lopez, is now in Osorno, Chile. Small world, because he got there and met my friend Thomas Crotzer, that's serving in the same mission. Venezuela is jsut a mess right now. After that, we went to the chapel and played capture the flag as a zone. It was fun, but as always in the game, people ended up arguing, so it ended. After that we had pizza. Then Muñoz and I went to Quillacollo, then just headed home. We now have our fridge in our room, so we are never going to need to leave. Our plans all fell through at night, so we just talked to Sonia. She has cool stories from the mission. Apparently, when President Hinckley was here to dedicate the temple, he saw Lehi and Sariah. Also, the other day Hna Dyer was making copies, and on one of the copies (pictures of the temple) Pres Dyer's uncle and grandpa appeared. We couldn't figure out how, there was no explanation, spooky. Other than that, just went home and, wait, we were getting home when Hna Chavez called, speaking so fast Muñozcouldn't understand. Well, we had to go give a blessing to Carina, who hurt her knee. It was good though, because Hno Chavez actually gave the blessing. Bedtime, chau.</p>
