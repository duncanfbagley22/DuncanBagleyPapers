            <h1>Week 11 <small>(April 7, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>HAPPY BIRTHDAY GRIFFIN!!!!</h3>
            <p><small>Family,<br>
                To start of I would just like to say HAPPY BIRTHDAY GRIFFIN!!!!!!!
             Crazy that you are already 18, stop being old. Yesterday was full of
             important days. It was conference, griff´s birthday, and transfers,
             all wrapped up in one night. Here is what came to pass throughout this
             week.<br>
             Monday-<br> We kinda just did nothing. With it being p day, it actually
             was nice to just relax for a second. We also had a FHE fall through,
             but we ended up teaching one of the school teachers of some of the
             girls in our ward, so it was productive.<br>
             Tuesday and Wednesday-<br>
                First of all, like everyday this week we had to do paperwork stuff
             in the city for our visas, so that took a lot of time out of each day.
             It is about an hour to get to the city for us, so that makes it hard.
             However, Tuesday and Wednesday we were with a member, Hna Chavez, all
             day long. She, along with her little daughter Tabitha, showed us all
             their friends and people they know. It really helped us get a few more
             people to teach. Members really are the key to everything here. People
             basically dont like us unless we are with members, and usually their
             friends are prepared to listen. Hna Chavez has a little 2 year old
             girl named Galilea, and she is just awesome. She is the little girl
             with the Coca Cola in the picture.<br>
             Thursday-<br>
               I went and finish basically everything for my visa, so probably this
             Thursday I will get my bolivian ID and I will be legal until october.<br>
             Friday-<br>
                Friday was not too great. We were all ready to have a great day. No
             tramites, and we had appointments the entire day. However, as we say
             here when something dumb happens "we are in Bolivia now". We had 5
             appointments on friday that fell through. It is really dumb when you
             get appointments set up and when you are there prepared to teach,
             either they arent home, their husband is there and wont let us teach,
             or they say "estoy haciendo" which literally means I am doing. We had
             15 appointments in total fall through this week, but luckily Friday
             night at like 7 30 we met the boyfriend of a less active member, and
             he was pretty cool. The member is 15 and the boyfriend is 18, and
             whatever you are imagining in your head of what they are like, it is
             completely opposite. It is the weirdest pair I have seen, but they are
             nice.<br>
             Saturday-<br>
                Conference. We had 4 investigators come to conference. Aydde and
             Gabriel, who are probably our best investigators right now, and the
             Flia Andia. This guy is a return missionary, but because of financial
             problems and he married a nonmember, he is less active. However, he
             wants to be active, and we are gonna help him. His son is named Nefi,
             so he just has to be active. Conference was good, except in the
             english room, the TV wouldnt work for the first 2 talks (one being
             Elder Holland...) and then we watched the rest of the session in
             spanish. The later sessions were in english though, so that was good.
             Between the last two sessions, I went with Elder Olson, Elder Bennett
             (Muñoz´s trainer) and Elder Rhoton to go buy pizza. The pizza is
             called the "interminable" or unfinishable. We almost finished it
             though. It is huge. It was cool to just hang out with those guys. As
             we left the pizza place, a random lady came up to me and asked what
             she needs to do to have missionaries come to her house if she wants to
             be a member. Well, we took down her address and number and passed them
             to the other elders in Quillacollo. One day I will find an
             investigator like that in El Paso. I really really like Elder Nelson´s
             talk, I dont have my notes right now, but it was power quote after
             power quote.<br>
             Sunday-<br>
                More conference. We watched it in a members house cause it was Dia
             de Peaton, or the day where it is illegal to use cars, so we couldnt
             really walk 7km to the church. It was all in spanish, but it was good.
             I am going to try to listen to it later in english, cause it is
             better. Then we had transfers, but no one is leaving thankfully.
             Today we are going to eat lunch with Muñoz´s old pensionista, so it
             will be free. Not much else to say, just the church is true and make
             sure to apply all the talks from conference, not just say they were
             good, but put them to use. Love you all, talk to you next week.<br><br>
                Elder Bagley<br>
             Ñoqa means I in quechua, me and Muñoz are going to try to learn so we
             can speak pure lamanite</small></p>

                      <p>Wow, it's already April, that was fast. Today we started out with the district meeting. I felt good about this class. I talked about being <u>full</u> time missionaries, a missionary in every moment. Then we watch a video a Christ and how we can perservere through our trials and still teach. It was good enough. After lunch we had an appt, or 2 fall through, then we went with Hna Chavez, Tabitha, and Galilea. We literally went to visit Tabitha's friends, and that resulted in one lesson, a new investigators, and about 2 appts planned for this week. It was actually effective, and we'll probably do it again. We also went with them to teach Maribel and Celestina. It was good to have Hna Chavez there as Celestina opened up more. She's having a hard time with changing. Throughout the day, we were pushing Galilea in a stroller and going off-roading. It was really cold tonight, I could see my breath. Overall, a good enough day, still weird it's April.</p>

                    <p>These days go so fast. We got up and went to do tramites for Muñoz in the city. I basically just sat there and talked to Elder Mickle and Elder Harris, so that was good enough. Then I bought some food at Wist'upiku, a bakery type place. After lunch we had a good lesson with Gabriel and Aydde. We taught about the BoM. Aydde seems pretty solid with it, Gabriel has his doubts about it, but he is interested. We feel like they are doing really well. After that, we went around with Hna Chavez and got to know some people. It had its ups and downs. We did, by "chance" met Marisol. She is the sister of Erik Menesez, a guy we met a few weeks ago. The sister just so happens to be a member, "chance". We met her and a lot of good people. Going with Hna Chavez has helped us so much. She knows a bunch of people and helps people open up. It is great. Well, we have to go back to the city tomorrow to do my papers, so I best be going to sleep.</p>

                    <p>Well, sometimes the mission is great, and sometimes it sucks, and sometimes it is both in the same day. In the morning we went to do my tramites. I think it was my last thing until I'm legal here and I have an ID. After that we got home and walked around, getting to know the area a little better. Don't know why, but Muñoz was mad. I tried talking to him, but he wouldn't really say anything. After lunch we taught lessons and whatnot. Finally we found the Flia Andia. Hno Andia was a cool guy. He served a mission, his son is named Nephi, and he really wants to come back to church. We'll be helping him in that. We got back at night and it started again. I asked Muñoz why he was mad, and that made him mad. I try to talk, but he doesn't take criticism, and finally I just stood up and left because I didn't wanna get more mad. I just don't know what to do. He is like bipolar. 50% super happy, 50% he is ready to kill me. It's tough because he gets mad, I ask him why, he doesn't tell me, then he gets more mad. If I bug him, he just needs to tell me, and not act like a child. We'll fix it tomorrow, but now I'm going to bed.</p>

                    <p>Well, I woke up, and obviously me and Muñoz were still a little mad. However, we got over it and talked it out. Muñoz figured out he needs to adjust to living with someone, not on his own anymore. I need to stop asking so many questions. It will hopefully stay like this for a while, we are gonna get along better. We were feeling good, up until we left. We started working, and had nothing. 5 appts fell through, and literally no one wanted anythings. Streets, knocking doors, visiting investigators, there was nothing. The only good part was when we were watching 2 dogs fight and one fully out bodyslammed the other. So hard it started crawling cause it couldn't walk. We were kinda discouraged, but we decided not to eat dinner until we had a lesson. We went to visit Celestina and Maribel, and ended up teaching Maribel's friend/boyfriend Benito. He was cool, and receptive, so we'll keep a watch on him. It was a hard day, but it ended well. We've had 15 appts fall through this week, so that's been kinda rough. Hoping conference can cheer me up.<br><br><br><br></p>

                    <p>Conference #2. Today had the first sessions of conference. We brought Gabriel and Aydde to the first session, and hopefully they liked it. The first session was supposed to be in english for us, but we couldn't get the satelitte figured out, so we watched in spanish and missed Elder Holland's talk, so that stunk. After the first session, we picked up dinner, then headed back. This time is was in english, and there was a great talk by Elder Russell M Nelson. After that, me, along with Elder Olson, Elder Rhoton, and Elder Bennett went to Eli's to buy a pizza. It was fun to hang out with them and just relax. On the way out, this random lady came up to me and basically said: "Are you elders (we said yes), how do I get the missionaries sent to me if I want to be a member of the church?" Well, that doesn't happen everyday. We took down the info and hopefully she turns out golden. Then we ate the giant pizza and watched priesthood session. It was great. As we left we though Jorge was going to give us a ride in his new $30,000 camaro, which is really nice, but he didn't, so we got home at 11. The Flia Andia came to a conference session too, so we were pretty happy. It was a good day, ready for more conference.</p>

                    <p>Conference part 2, transfers, and Happy Birthday to my brother Griffin Bagley. This time we had conference in the house of Pres. Orellana in El Paso. It was still a good conference, but I had to watch it in Spanish. I understand what they say, but I just like it better in English. We had like 30 people in the first session. However, in the second session, just 8, and 4 were missionaries. We had a good talk with Andrea Orellana. She really mants to serve a mission. She's a good example of what I should've been like before the mission. After that, we just went to dinner and then came back home. At dinner, Watts and Tiahin gave us fake cambios, I knew they'd do it, and they almost convinced me until they said I was going to be ZL, so I knew it was a lie. However, at night, we got the real ones. The only people from the district that are going are Elder Edmonds and Hna Perez. There are hardly any changes in the mission, there are people staying with their comps for a third cambio. Oh well, I'm just ready for a new cambio, and p-day.</p>

                    <p>P-day. To tell the truth, it was kinda boring. We went to internet, and I guess I must be old now, cause no one writes me. Just the family basically. I need Griffin to go on his mission so I can get interesting letter from at least. But, at least I have a family that loves me. Other than internet, we went over to Muñoz´s old area to see his pensionista. We found out Hernandez had a cambio. He is in cambio 5 with 3 areas and 5 comps. I'm in cambio 7 with 2 areas and 4 comps. But, it sounds like he was improving. After that, we went to Luigi's and saw Elder Long and Elder Alexander, good to see them after a while. We stayed there and talked, then went to talk with Muñoz´s friends; Elder Torres, Elder Palma, and Elder Muñoz. They're pretty cool guys, the friends Muñoz should have. Then we went home, but we had to clean the bathroom because Apaza and Pinta forgot to, so we did it and left them the scripture D and C 88:124. Then we made invitations for the 7_55 concert, and ate dinner. Relatively boring p-day, but a good day nonetheless.</p>
