            <h1>Week 10 <small>(March 31, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Hitchhiker´s Guide to Bolivia aka The Prodigal Son</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family<br>
                I couldnt decide what the title should be, so I put 2. I will explain...
             1) Today is just your normal day in Bolivia... People are protesting
             in the streets and not letting the buses through because they are
             charging 2 Bolivianos and the people want it to be 1.90 for a ride
             from Quillacollo to Cochabamba. For those of you not familiar with
             Bolivianos, 10 centavos would literally be a penny. So, for a penny,
             there is basically no transport today. Not too bad, except we live 7
             KM from anything. So, not wanting to spend all day in El Paso, we
             started to walk. We tried to flag down the few taxis, but everything
             was full. So, what happened... Mom is gonna hate me... we hitchhiked.
             Nobody stopped, but eventually we got a ride with some nice people.
             Also, they just happened to know the church and almost got baptized a
             few years ago, so we gave them a BoM, and we got a ride for free. Good
             stuff<br>
             2) So... transfers, kinda. There was apparently something that
             happened in Sucre Central, my old zone, and 1 person from every
             companionship got changed. Part of that, Elder Gubler went to Sucre in
             Barrio Universidad, and who came to replace him... The one and only
             Elder Pinta. It is weird living with my old companion. I am used to it
             now, but it is a little... peculiar. But, he told me that Hector and
             Dennys are still doing well in Sucre, so that is good. The real
             transfers are next sunday.<br><br>
             
             So other than that, this is what happened.<br>
             1) Interviews, we had our interviews with president. He talk about how
             I need to get up on time better (I dont sleep in really late, but
             sometimes I will accidently fall back asleep until 7) and how we need
             more faith. Also, they are thinking about putting Hermanas in our
             ward, having 6 missionaries.<br>
             2) Conference, we had a conference with 3 zones. Alamos (us),
             Tiquipaya (pretty green, rich part of the city), and Universidad (the
             people that probably only teach in aparment towers and have cold AND
             hot water. Basically, while everyone else showed up in taxis and live
             5-10 minutes away, we took a 50 minute trufi ride. I got to see Elder
             Harris from Sucre, Elder Harwood from the MTC, and Elder Robertson (my
             first ZL who is now AP). It was a good conference, I learned a lot,
             and hopefully we will put everything into practice.<br>
             3) Flia Ticona, they are a family of less actives that flagged us down
             in the street this last week and wanted to talk. Well, we went on
             Saturday and met Karla (the aunt, baptized in 2003 and had callings
             and everything) Nicole (baptized a few years ago, she is 12) and
             Michelle (10, never got baptized, and when we asked if she wanted to
             get baptized was so happy it was weird). Well, they all came to church
             yesterday and we have FHE with them tonight<br>
             That would be the most important things that happened this week. We
             have 1 other investigator that came to church, Aydde. She has come
             before, and we are trying hard to work with her. She is pretty
             receptive and likes the church. We also have the Flia Nuñez, but they
             couldnt come to church this week because there was a father´s day
             activity at their school. Overall, it was a good enough week. We had a
             bus full of people that came from El Paso to church, and we are
             feeling good. We are basically out of money, but we should get some
             tomorrow. <br><br>Love you all, Q´ayacama<br>

                      <p>Uhh, I am so sore. Not sure why, but my arms and legs are just dying. Today was good, but we didn't get a lot of work done, but we learned a lot. We had our district meeting. It was good enough, I learned 2 cool scriptures: Joel 3:10 (makes weak things strong) and 2 Cor 12:10 (rejoice in trials). I feel like my classes are at least getting better. After that, we headed to the offices for interviews. Basically, president just told me I need more faith. At times it is hard to judge how much faith I have, but I'm going to focus on it. Also I need to get up on time. Other that that, we just talked to the Flia Huarayo. They've definitely stopped progressing, but we need to get them going again. They always "don't have time", but there's always time. Conference day tomorrow, hope it's good.</p>

                    <h3>March 26, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Conference day. We had to get to the Universidad stake center at 8:45, which means we left our house at 7:40. We got there, and I got to see a bunch of old friends: Elder Harris, Elder HArwood, Elder Jerrell, and all those guys. It was a good conference. President Dyer talked a lot about the importance of the BoM, Hna Dyer talked about empathy vs sympathy, and the assistants talked about applying the way we teach better to the investigators. We had a fun activity where we had to write down things we wanted other people to do, but we ended up having to do it. I just had to hug Elder Cruz, but others sang and danced and stuff. It was pretty funny. I enjoyed the conference, except for the part where I had to get up and talk about my district. I don't know why, but it made me nervous. After the conference, we didn't really have a lot of time to work, so we ended up only teaching a lesson to Maribel, a less active. She'll hopefully be coming to church on Sunday. Good enough for conference day, until June for the next one.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes Muñoz is a bit anal. He is addicted to planning, every tiny detail. We had weekly planning, that's why I mention it. He just has to do it perfectly, and he makes it take as long as possible. But it's weird, because even though he is so into it, he always leaves most of it to me. He wants to plan, but he still is learning how, so I do most of it. That probably doesn't make much sense, but oh well. We had 2 lessons today. First, we taught Ana Paula. She is a regular old person in that she likes to talk, but she actually understands, and is interested. Basically, she just needs to pray, find out if it is true. If she does, I don't think we'll have problems. After that, we talk Karen with Hna Chavez's help. She actually read, so now we are going to hopefully keep her reading. I think the husband is a speedbump for right now, but we'll work on it. At night, we went to the "meeting" with Jorge, but he didn't show up until 9, so nothing really happened. However, there is interesting news. Apparently, in Sucre they went to 7 waterfalls, and at a difficult part to climb, some people jumped in and swam. Well, some Hermanas told on them, and now the whole zone has cambios. As part, Elder Gubler is going to Barrio Universidad to be with Elder Cossio. And, to replace Elder Gubler, we are getting... Elder Pinta. He's going to be Apaza's new comp. It's going to be weird living with one of my old comps, eating with him, being in the same ward. He'll be good though, I'm excited to see him again. It'll be interesting to see him on Saturday.</p>

                    <p>Today was boring. We are doing well in the mornings right now, we get up at 6:30 +/- and are dressed and ready to go at 8. Then we do all 4 hours of study. The toughest study is language, because in order to learn Muñoz has to ask about everything. We only had 2 lessons. Firstly, we taught Hna Celestina. She's got some reason she doesn't come to church, but she just says she doesn't have time, which is almost always a lie. We'll keep working with her though. As we left, we saw a little girl run up to her cholita mom, and her mom hit her with a bag, pretty weird. After that, we were working on our "encontrar as esnaikiar, esnaikiar al encontrar" and we found a girl named Andrea. Not too interested, but who knows. Finally, we talked to Hermana Else, and they gave us smoothies. We got to dinner, and Benita made a pie, that was really good. Overall, the day was good enough. I had a good chat with Gubler. Maybe I don't have many baptisms, but I know I've helped some missionaries.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <h3>March 29, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Today was different. We got up normal, studied, and all that stuff. However, around 12 I was just talking to Muñoz and I just lost it and started crying. Sometimes it is really hard on me not having much success, and today all of it culminated and I just started crying. Good to let out some emotion. I still don't have answers to all my questions, but I'm doing better. We met up with Elder Pinta today. Weird to see my old comp, but he is doing really well. We had lunch with the Flia Chavez, and they took a long time to get the food out (1 1/2 hrs) but it was good. After lunch, we went to go meet with Andrea, but met her sister Daniela instead, and she's more of a snake. She was a little more interested though. Later, we took a picture in a wheat field, and we're going to put D&C 4:3 on it and it'll look cool. We then taught a less active, Karla Ticona, and her 2 nieces, Nicole (member) and Michelle (nonmember). They're really cool people, and Michelle accepted a baptismal date (April 19) easier than anyone in history. To end the nigh, we finally caught up with Aydde and talked about the BoM. She's still interested, so there's hope. It was a hard day to start out, but it turned out ok.</p>

                    <p>Sunday, fast sunday. I think I have like 13 more fast sundays in the mission. Today I went with Israel to consejo de barrio, and Muñoz went with Alejandro to pick people up. I got to church, said my stuff, and when the bus got there it was full. We had 2 investigators (Aydde and Michelle), like 5 less actives, and basically all the members. I was happy. Church was just normal. After we ate lunch with some family in the ward. Sometimes it is weird being the only gringo, I get excluded a little. After lunch, we went around, had appts fall through, and just normal. We went to contact these 2 girls we know that sell empanadas. We got there, and everything started out perfect. They set up chairs, gave us food, and it seemed perfect. We started talking to the mom, and she started to tell us the story of her life. It took like 30min, and we couldn't get a word in. Hardly anything happened, except that we listened to her. That made us late for our next appt with Pres Orellana, and then we had to take a taxi to our other lesson, which fell through. Well, that just kinda ended the night. Just barely, Muñoz started bugging me by touching all my stuff. It bugs me more when I ask him to stop, and he just doesn't respect me. Now, I do anything, and the Latinos gang up on me, it sucks. I'll try to work it out. Oh well, at least it's p-day tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>This was a very interesting p-day. We got up, and left at about 10. However, we found out there weren't any trufis leaving El Paso. We didn't know what else to do, so we started walking. We got about 1.5km down the 7km road, and we'd been trying to hitchhike the whole way, but finally someone decided to take. Just by "chance", it was a family that almost got baptized a while ago, so we gave the a BoM and hopefully they read it. It was all part of the plan. After that, we had internet, then we went to the city. I had no money on my card, so I had to change some dollars that I had. However, I went to a bank, but you can only change money with a Bolivian ID, so since my papers are in tramites still, we had to walk like 5 blocks to find a place to change money. After that, we ate lunch, then walked around for a bit, before going home. We had a plan to have an FHE with Karla Ticona, but after walking 15 minutes, we found out she wasn't there. Well, then we walk 15 minutes back to just talk with the Flia Chavez. We got there, and there was a guy there fixing their computer. Well, we decided to teach him. His name is Enrique, and he was super receptive. And thus we see the hand of the Lord leading us to people, even though it isn't how we plan. It ended up being a pretty good day I guess.</p>
