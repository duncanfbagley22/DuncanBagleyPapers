            <h1>Week 6 <small>(March 3, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Llachtamasis (Homie in Quechua)</h3>
            <p><small>How is everyone?<br> Glad dad got home from South Africa? I am still
             livin the life in El Paso. This week brought a lot of changes. First
             of all, my new companion, Elder Muñoz. 5 fun facts of Elder Muñoz<br>
             1) From Guayaquil Ecuador<br>
             2) Only member in his family, he was baptized in Nov, 2012.<br>
             3) 19 years old<br>
             4) Has 2 months in the mission<br>
             5) I think he kinda looks like Bruno Mars<br>
             He is awesome. He started out in Jaihuayco (South side Cocha), and
             kinda got thrown into a house with 3 bad missionaries. He needs a bit
             of correcting of things that the other missionaries taught him (like
             rules and stuff), but overall he is awesome. We get along great, and
             laugh all the time. When he teaches, the spirit is super strong. I am
             excited to work with him some more. He wants to be obedient, just
             doesnt know how all the way.<br>
             As far as district leader, my district is awesome. It is me, Muñoz,
             Elder Edmonds (went to Brighton has 6 months), Elder Cruz (from
             Guatemala, has 21 months), Hna Gardiner (from Kaysville, from my
             group), Hna Pérez (from Guatemala, has 3 months), Elder Tiahin (from
             Beni Bolivia, Zone Leader, has 15 months), and Elder Watts (from
             Logan, ZL, 12 months). I love my district. They all work, but are easy
             going. Elder Cruz started in Churuquella too, so we talk about that.
             All the older guys help me out a lot. I have already had to teach a
             class (it went pretty well I guess) and I gave a baptismal interview
             (a little 12 yr old, it was easy) I enjoy being district leader cause
             it makes me more responsible and all that. The goal for the district
             for march is 18 baptisms, we have 2 so far, so we are getting there.
             Elder Apaza is from the ghetto of Lima, but he is really cool. He is
             patient with elder Gubler, which is different than before. I get along
             well with him.<br>
             This is what´s up with investigators<br>
             Braulio y Cristian- They are the ones that have a baptismal date for
             the 14th. They are great, and both now know that they need to be
             baptized and have prayed and received their answer from God. They mom
             always makes them help her in her job, so they couldnt come to church
             yesterday, but are hopefully going to an activity in the church today.<br>
             Hernan- He is a 16 yr old, and likes the church. He is a little weird,
             but still good. We are slowly getting him to baptism<br>
             Edson- the guy from the circus. He was doing so well, reading,
             praying, everything. Friday was had a strong lesson, but we got there
             on Saturday and he was so drunk we couldnt teach because it wasnt a
             safe environment. We will see how it goes with him, but Saturday it
             was hard to see him like that.<br>
             Flia Nuñez- Wednesday we went with Alejandro, this kid in the ward,
             and he showed us around some houses where missionaries had taught
             before. We found this family. They are Elsa (the grandma, she´s a
             member, but hadnt been to church for 7 years before yesterday),
             Rosella (21, she is basically the mom for her siblings), Cristian (16,
             came to church yesterday), Rodrigo (14), and Franco (8). They are a
             cool family and already know a lot about the church. We are excited to
             teach them.<br>
             That about does it for investigators. We are working on finding this week.
             Other cool things that happened.<br>
             Carnaval- it is this week. We arent allowed to work until Wednesday
             because of it. People just walk around throwing water balloons and
             using squirt guns. I got hit with a bucket of water yesterday.<br>
             Service- I remember one time, dad told me people used machetes to cut
             their grass. I didnt really believe it, but Saturday that is what we
             did. It was so hard, but fun to use a machete. A lot of my pics are me
             and Edmonds with machetes. Also, we cleaned the unfinished floor of a
             house, and lowered the dirt down 3 stories using a pulley. There is a
             picture of Elder Apaza doing that.<br>
             Dog- I got bit by a dog. A small one at the pensionista. Just nibble
             my ankle. I deserved it though, cause I accidently stepped on its
             foot.<br>
             Lady with a stick- we contacted some lady in the street, and some how
             she ended up holding a big stick. She basically told us we were
             bothering her and her face wasnt inviting. We left, and laughed cause
             we literally thought she was gonna hit us with a stick.<br>
             That´s about it. Me and Elder Muñoz are getting along great, and this
             week will be full of success. The Dear Elder package came, so thank
             you for that. Love you so much, the church is TRUE.<br><br>

                      <p>First day with a new comp. In the morning we dropped Lopez off at the airport, then went to the Universidad Stake for cambios. I met my new comp, Elder Muñoz. He's a little Ecuadoriano guy, and he's only been a member for 1 1/2 years. He's awesome though. He's a little quiet, but still awesome. We visited the circus people. Still going great, hopefully on track to be baptized. Later we visited Hna Quispe cause she called asking us to. Well, we talked for a while, and found out she's in rough shape. Her husband is drinking again and is scared he wants to abuse her daughter. She's been finding her daughter's clothes in the dad's room for no reason and is scared. We called the bishop and Gaby Siles and tried to solve everything. As missionaries we handle a lot. We visited Carlos Alarcon and heard his conversion story. Finally, we taught Braulio and Cristian. Overall, a very stressful day with the stuff with the Flia Quispe, but we got through it, so everything is good enough for now. I'm happy to have Elder Muñoz. Found out he got switched because his trainer was a macanero, so half way through the training, they transfered him to me. I'm tired now, so I'm going to sleep.</p>

                    <h3>February 26, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Pucha, voy a escribir today esta parte en español, solo para mostrar que puedo. Me gustó hoy dia, actualmente, fue difícil fisicalmente, pero al final me sentí muy bien por el trabajo que hicimos. Hoy, estudiamos, almorzamos, y luego empezamos a trabajar. Un joven del barrio, Alejandro, vino con nosotros hoy, todo el dia. Nos ayudó bastante. El siempre iba con los misioneros antes, entonces conoce muchas partes y personas que nosotros no conociamos. Encontramos un joven se llama Alejandro que se bautizó hace algunos meses. Él estaba menos activo, y tenía miedo de volver a la iglesia por vergüenza. Resolvimos todo y ya va a venir. Tambien encontramos la familia Nuñez. Es una hermana que se bautizó hace 7 años más o menos, pero despues se fue a Chaparre, por 7 años. Justamente, vovlio viernes, la encontramos, y tiene 4 nietos que viven alla que no son miembros. Visitamos a Jacqueline luego, y despues se acabó la noche. Caminamos muchísimo hoy, pero es mejor cuando Alejandro, Muñoz, y yo hablábamos. Con Hernandez, eso nunca pasó. Mi campañero es buenismo. Su testimonio es super fuerte y siempre trae el Espiritu. Me gusta trabajar con el y sé que vamos a tener éxito. Esto es todo de hoy. Averigúe que mi distrito va a ser Jardin II y todo Colcapirhua, y eso es lo que yo quería. Si no entiendes mi español, va a disculpar, per soy Boliviano ahora.</p>

                    <p>I really like my comp. Every day gets better with him. We started out today by doing service with the Flia Murillo. We swept a bunch, put stuff in buckets, then lowered them down by pulley. It wasn't too bad, and we didn't have to work in the sun at all. We went to lunch, and almost got killed by some dogs. We left, but then went back home to give Gubler a blessing. Then we visited the circus. They are still progressing well, and should be able to be baptized. They move like every month, so we're gonna ask the ZL's if we can continue teaching when they move. I also had to call people in the district to organize a service project. I feel weird having the responsibility. We taught a few other people, then we had a lesson with Braulio and Cristian. It was great, cause Braulio got his answer and wants to be baptized. We need permission from their older brother, but then we'll be good. Really, I'm enjoying like. Muñoz is awesome, Apaza too. There's gonna be lots of success, I can feel it. I'm kinda scared for my class tomorrow, but hopefully it goes well.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <h3>February 28, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Well, there went February. That was quick. Today I taught my first district class. It went good enough for the first one. My district is awesome. Me, Elder Edmonds, Elder Watts, and Hna Gardiner from Utah, Elder Tiahin from Bolivia, Elder Muñoz from Ecuador, and Elder Cruz and Hna Pérez from Guatemala. Other than that, there was only one other good thing. We had a great lesson with Edson from the circus. Elder Muñoz is a great teacher. The spirit is strong when he teaches. Edson is a good guy. His past is sketchy, but he wants to change. Other that that, we just had our reunion with Jorge. Oh ya. I gave my first interview. A little 12 yr old named Kevin, an investigator of Elder Edmonds and Elder Cruz. It wasn't too hard, a different experience, but it was good. Not much else to say, just ready for March.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <p>Wow, March. Crazy how fast time goes. Today we did the worst yet best service project. We literally cut grass with Machetes. It was a cool experience, but ridiculously hard. 6 machetes, 3 hours, and we got less done than a lawnmower could have done in 20min. Sometimes I realize the lack of technology in Bolivia. After that we had lunch with Gaby Siles, Jorge's wife. After that was the worst part of the day. WE went to go teach Edson, but we got there and he was super drunk. Him and 2 other guys were sitting outside just drinking, and they'd probably been like that for some time, as they were wearing their clothes from the day before. It was hard to see him like that. Making so much progress, and then it all came crashing down. We couldn't pass through the door cause we thought it was too dangerous. It hurts to watch someone so great be destroyed by alcohol. Later, we went to Hernan's to teach him. He's a bit odd, but a good kid. Finally, we met and taught the Flia Nuñez. Hna Elsa, Hna Rosella, Cristian, Rodrigo, and Franco. They're a grandma and her grandkids. They're cool, and could definitely progress. After, we went home, made a map of the area (printed), then did weekly planning. We gave a blessing to E' Apaza cause he's really sick. I got in a small fight with Gubler, but it all turned out ok. We contracted a bus, so hopefully there's a bunch of people that come to church tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>Well, not a lot of people came to church, but it wasn't a failure. We did take the bus to church, but only the Flia Riveros and Benita's family came. Everyone that usually comes said they were gonna come a different way. There were some good things that happened. Alejandro, a lesser active, came to church. Also Hna Elsa and Cristian came, so that was good. We were so hungry during church. We basically ran to lunch, and when we got there we drank 2.5 lts of coke so fast. We ate with Vito Layton and his mom. He's an RM and gave us lots of cool ideas. After getting home we went to go teach Flia. Huarayo. On the way, I got a bucket of water dumped on me, but it felt good. We ended up only teaching Marco, the oldest brother. It was a great lesson. He's really humble and understands. Later, we were wlaking, couldn't find anything, so we talked to these people in the street. They weren't too interested, and when the girl appeared holding a stick, that along with her death glare, made us end quickly. At Benita's, I accidently stepped on a dog, so it bit my (I guess I deserved it). I reported numbers for the first time, but it's easy. I'm tired, so I'm gonna sleep now.</p>

                    <p>Pi-dai. This p-day was good enough. My first one as DL, and it actually does mean something on p-day too. We went to internet as a district, and then we went to Chicken's Kingdom. I really like my district. Everyone is awesome and we all get along great. After that me and Muñoz went to Quillacollo, where I got my haircut, we bought some things, and I ended up buying an Inter Milan jersey and shorts. Both combined was like 55bs, or about $8, not too bad. Then we went to the "ward activity" to play futsal, except only 2 young men showed up, so me, Muñoz, and them played against Colcatiras, aka Edmonds, Cruz, Tiahin, and Watts. It was pretty fun, and I did well. We went home and experienced Carnaval. It's the biggest waterfight ever. There's gangs of little kids that walk around with their squirt guns and balloons, trucks beds of people with buckets full of water, and people dumping water from roof tops. We got home, did the same, and dumped water on people. However, people stormed upstairs to get us. We tried to hide, but me and Apaza got wet. Muñoz and Gubler hid, but I made the people (2 girls, the guy that lives downstairs, and some little kid) a deal. They could get Muñoz and Gubler wet if we could teach them. Needless to say, we have 2 new references to teach. After that, we just talked, me, Muñoz, and Apaza. I realized that I need to love people. Not just want to baptize them, or help them, but I need to love them. It was a good day, ready for p-day #2.</p>
