            <h1>Week 8 <small>(March 17, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Thrown out</h3>
            <p><small>Familia amada, querida, bonita, y mas<br>
                This week went by really really fast. I cant remember what happened
                which day, so I will just explain in little points<br>
                - Sick. I have had a cold this week. I am starting to get over it, but
                right now it has moved down to my throat, so my voice sounds like
                death. I keep working, but Friday I was ready to die at night cause I
                was drained of energy<br>
                - 7_55 We met a famous band, well Bolivian band. They are called "La
                7_55". Jorge, the WML, knows them (he knows everyone), and invited
                them to perform in the chapel. They are going to do a show for the
                12th of april. We had a meeting with them on Thursday to make sure
                everything was good, and they are awesome. We gave them BoMs,
                Liahonas, hymn books, and all that. They sing a song called "lejos de
                ti". Go look it up, I cant listen to it, but you guys can. They even
                came to church yesterday<br>
                - Hernandez and Bennett. On Friday, Elder Hernandez and Elder Bennett
                came to visit. Apparently, Hernandez misses me a whole lot, which is
                weird cause when he was here, he hated me half the time. Oh well, at
                least I left a good impression<br>
                -Investigators We are feeling really good about 3 investigators right
                now. Gabriel and Aydde Caceres, and Javier Soliz. They all have come
                to church and they enjoy it. We just need to put a baptismal challenge
                and then we will be rolling. We have a family that came to church
                yesterday too. The Flia Nuñez. They are grandkids of a member, but
                they arent baptized. They will require some work on the members side,
                but we will get there. Actually, we had 8 investigators at church
                yesterday, so that was cool. Braulio and Cristian are the ones that
                were going to be baptized, but they have gone down a little bit. We
                are going to go tomorrow and talk, maybe threaten to leave them, to
                show them how important it is. We have been talking to a lot more
                people, it hasnt given a lot of fruits yet, but it will.<br>
                -Thrown out I got kicked out of a house for the first time on my
                mission. We had an investigator named Hernan, 16 years old. He was
                progressing well, came to church like 4 times, was praying and all
                that. We got there on Saturday, and met his dad for the first time in
                7 weeks. As he was leaving to go do something down the street, the dad
                told us that we couldnt take his son to church anymore. Well, that
                scared us a bit, but we asked permission from the wife if we could
                come in. She said yes, so we started teaching Hernan about 2 Ne 31. We
                got to verse 20, and the dad came back. He came in and told us to
                leave and never come back. Well, that kinda was a bummer, but all we
                could do after was laugh.<br>
                - Muñoz Still going well. We have a lot of fun, but we are working
                harder than before. We should have a lot of success soon
                Other than that, I cant really think of anything. I am gonna hit 9
                months on Wednesday, which is weird cause that means all the sisters
                that left with me are half way done. We were going to have a
                conference with a member of the 70, but it got cancelled. Not much
                else to say. Life is good, cant complain<br><br>
                Con cariño y amor y muchos abrazos<br>
                Elder Bagley</small></p>

                      <p>Well, for some reason, my thighs are really sore. I think it's from squatting during paintball. We had a zone meeting today. It was good, but a lot of time, zone meetings are slow cause they take about 2-2 1/2 hours. We had a few lessons during the day. The first was with some kid named Wilfredo. We were looking for his grandma, who's a member. She wasn't there, but we talked to him instead. He was a bit rough at first, didn't want much to do with us. However, we asked some questions and got him interested. He asked a lot of questions as well. It was a battle to get his phone #, but we got it, and we'll be in contact. Later we talked to the Flia Huarayo, specifically Cristian. We had a real nice talk with just him, and he is ready for baptism. We'll need to clear things with his family, but we'll get there. Not much else to say, we talked to Sonia and Benita about stories they have about mission presidents and stuff. I'm tired, and my legs hurt, I'm going to bed.</p>

                    <p>I can't really remember much of what happened, so I'll just list the important things.<br>-In the morning, we left to work. We taught Cesar, a shoe maker. He's nice, but just wants to listen, not do anything.<br>-We were looking for old investigators, but we ran into a girl named Mayra. She's a member, but hasn't been to church in about a year. She has desires to come back, so it was great that we found her by "chance"<br>-We came back home to study, but accidently fell asleep. Anytime I'm home in the afternoon, I fall asleep.<br>-A few appts fell through, but we met a girl named Alicia. We talked for a bit, and seemed interested.<br>-We talked to Hernan. He knows it's true, just kinda shy to act on things. We were reading his little bible stories book, and for some reason it quoted 1 Ne 2, talked about Lehi, but only mentioned the BoM in one part, kind weird.<br>-We've started talking to more people, give out cards on trufis, and stuff like that. Not many results yet, but we are at least spreading the word.<br>-I'm getting sick with a cold, so I'm gonna go to sleep now.</p>

                    <p>I'm sick, and I don't like it. I've just got a cold, but it drains me of energy, makes it hard to work. Today was... eh. We had 2 lessons. Firstly, we were with Gaby Siles and we met this lady named Wilma. She's got a bunch of problems with her family and really opened up to us. We had a good lesson with her, and it seemed like she was interested in learning more. Then we talked with Marisol, but that is really just listening to her talk. After that, we somehow ran into the elders from Bella Vista. They think part of El Paso is theirs, and Robinson Vaca was showing them around to all the members, and telling them they should go to Bella Vista. Robinson made it on the list of people I don't like right now. Later we found 2 old people that liked us until we started talking about the BoM. They really didn't want anything to do with the book after that. The only times on the missions where I get heated is when people are against the BoM. Finally, our "meeting" with Jorge. Actually, we just talked to the musical group "La 7_55". They are going to do a concert April 12th, and should draw a lot of people. They were cool guys, really nice, and accepted the BoM, Liahona, and stuff like that. Hopefully the concert can get a bunch of people to the chapel. Oh well, I'm still sick, so I need sleep.</p>

                    <h3>March 14, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Estoy hecho tiras. Today I was sicker than yesterday. I had to take a 1:30 nap cause I was so hecho tiras. Today, we didn't teach a lot of lessons, but we did get like 4 references. The one lesson was with Nayra. We somehow met up with a less-active named David Sanchez, who took us to meet a reference. Well, it was a 20 minute walk through dirt roads and all that. We got there, and found out the reference had passed away, but we taught someone in the family. More or less interested, so we'll go back later. On the way back, I was dying. With a cold, my back hurt, and I was chafing. I wanted to die. That basically finished the night. Something else that happened was Elder Hernandez and Elder Bennett came to visit. I guess it was good to see him, but made me remember that I like Muñoz more. We talked with them both for a while. Bennett is a cool kid, lazy as a missionary, but a cool kid. Apparently, Hernandez misses me a lot. Like so much he has cried. Weird, cause half the time he hated me here. Oh well, at least I left a good impression. Glad I could help someone. However, I work more in a week with Muñoz than 4 with Hernandez.<br><br><br><br></p>

                    <h3>March 15, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Today was a rollercoaster. For lunch, I thought I knew how to get there, but I was wrong. We had to take a taxi, walk a bunch, but we finally got there. After lunch, our 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock, and 3 plan B appts fell through. I was pretty dissappointed. At 6, we went to teach Hernan. However, we also met his dad. His dad doesn't want him to talk to us. When we got there, the dad told us that we can't take him to church anymore. Scared us a bit, but we told Hernan to ask his mom if we could come in. He told us to come in, so we did and started reading 2 Ne 31. We got to verse 20, and the dad came in, told us to leave, and never come back. Well, we left, told Hernan that we couldn't come back, but that he should read the BoM. Some day it'll be his time to accept the gospel. First time I've been kicked out of a house, but all we could do was laugh. Later, we contact a referenced named Javier Soliz. He's a cool guy, interested, and said he'll come to church tomorrow. Finally, we taught the Flia Nuñez. They are cool, the 2 teenage boys will require some work, but the whole family knows a lot. BoM, Joseph Smith, a lot. Hopefully, they'll come to church. As we were leaving the Barrio, a lady named Karla called us over. She is a inactive, but wants to come to church, so we'll be working with her. Today started awful, but ended well. That's how the mission goes sometimes.</p>

                    <h3>March 16, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Sunday, the most stressful day. We went on splits with the ward missionaries. I went with Israel, and Muñoz with Alejandro. We had pretty good success today. There are 4 families that I can count as active here, Flia Chavez, Flia Quispe, Flia Riveros, and Benita's family. At least someone from each family came today. Javier Soliz came as well. Actually, we had 8 investigators, my record. Javier, 3 from Flia Nuñez, the niece of Hna Chavez, and the 3 guys from the band 7_55. I sang by the band on a hymn, so that makes me important. We got everyone organized in their classes, with members helping, so all was well. Rodrigo Nuñez was a bit stubborn, but he got there. Muñoz didn't wanna go to priesthood, so I just left him to send a message. He came, and we worked everything out. We had lunch with the Flia Foronda. We got there, started eating, then Gubler and Apaza showed up an hour later. The family are all converts from 2005 +/-. They were cool, but the gave us a whole lot of food. I barely finished half. We went home, talked to Apaza for a bit about what to do with Gubler. Gubler causes a lot of problems, and it is hard on Apaza. We then went to the plaza, contacted a few people sitting there, then just went to dinner. Good enough day, this week went super fast.</p>

                    <p>P p p p  p-day. It always goes so fast. I blinked, and then it was over. Internet was good, found out my cousin Seth really is AP in Mexico. I'm really happy for him, just surprised a bit. He's changed a lot for the better. After internet, we went bowling. It was fun, I was a lot better in college, but I still got a 120, good enough. Then we went to Gringo Burger, a little shack owned by a member of the church here that is from Oklahoma. It was good food, greasy, but good. After that we went to Muñoz's old area. I met his pensionista and stuff, she was cool. All the people there were pretty cool who I met. It's just they all get bad missionaries for the most part. The pensionista was saying how highly Hernandez talks about me, and how much of a headache he is. We did leave late to get home, so I was a bit cranky. Then we got home, and Muñoz was being slow, so I kinda got mad at him, gave him waska for not being focused. We ironed it out, so everything is good. We had a quick FHE with the Flia. Chavez, and then came home. It was a good day, but it did go too quick.</p>
