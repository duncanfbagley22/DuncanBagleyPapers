            <h1>Week 17 <small>(May 19, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Threat Level Midnight</h3>
            <p><small>My Dearest Family,<br><br>

                Well, I had always wanted to use that title for one of my letters,
            but I never had a reason to, until now. It is a reference to that
            Office episode when Michael writes his own movie called Threat Level
            Midnight. I am going to talk about why my letter is called that a bit
            later. This was quite the interesting week for Elder Bagley in El
            Paso. It all started on Monday. After I wrote to you guys, we went
            home. However, there is a custom in Bolivia where the people have
            blockeos. I am sure I mentioned it before, but whenever they aren’t
            happy with something (bus prices, unpaved roads, lack of water, even
            when the government tries to gives them water but they don’t want it)
            the people take to the streets and just stay there. They block the
            roads so that no one can pass. Usually they do it in the road between
            Cochabamba and Quillacollo, and we live right on the border of the 2
            provinces, so it always causes problems for us. This time, everything
            was blocked, and that is a problem when you live 6 km from everything.
            So, we walked… 7km to get home. It was awful, in the sun and all that,
            it made for a poor finish to p day. Tuesday, nothing too special.
            Wednesday, we had a service project with our Pensionista, along with a
            whole other zone of missionaries and President and Hermana Dyer. We
            were cutting dead plants and stuff like that. I got a blister on my
            hand. Then we ate sloppy joes, which is a delicacy for us. Thursday
            was boring as well. Friday we had to do an intercambio with the ZLs
            because they had an appointment at 10, but we had an interview at 10,
            so Elder Tiahin went up to El Paso and I went down to work with Elder
            Watts. We went to teach the members of that band, La 7_55, because
            they live in the ZLs area. Well, the lead singer is a child star all
            grown up, and is a prototypical famous person, so he slept until 12
            and never came out of his room. We did teach the drummer and the
            keyboard player. They were cool, and pretty open. I never want to live
            the band lifestyle though. I like being normal. After the lesson, we
            asked to play the piano. I played a little bit, and then Elder Watts
            just started going crazy on the piano. He plays really well. They were
            all impressed and said they would hire us and fire the current player,
            half joking. It was a fun experience. After that, I can´t remember
            what happened. Saturday, was the best day of the week, because… we had
            our baptism for Benito. We had lunch with the Flia Calle. They have a
            son in Cusco, but I asked Jamison and he doesn’t know him yet. The
            hermana has a way cool conversion story. When she was younger, she had
            a dream of 2 people showing up to her house wearing a light blue shirt
            and the other in a brown coat. 11 years later, 2 missionaries randomly
            knocked on her door, wearing a light blue sweater and the other in a
            brown coat. It was cool to hear her testimony. After that, we had to
            set up everything for the baptism, because getting help from the
            members in that is a nearly impossible assignment. People are so lazy
            here. Anyways, we had the baptism at 7 at night, and it was cool
            because when we asked Benito who he wanted to baptism him, he chose
            the bishop, which is more than perfect. It was a good service, and
            then we ate a lot of food after. We got home late, for like the 3rd
            time this week. Sunday, Benito even showed up early (impressive when
            he lives 25min from the chapel in bus). I got to confirm him, and it
            is a neat experience confirming people. I definitely did better this
            time. After church, we ate with the Flia Cabellero, this younger
            family of converts of about 10 years. They are super cool and are
            super excited for missionary work. I also talked to our 2nd counselor,
            Hno Cadima, and he said he knew Jim Combs´ brother in the mission.
            Then we went to a lesson with a recent convert from before my time,
            then we had dinner. Benita made us strawberry pie (she has permission
            from Pres to use lettuce, strawberries, and all that). It was
            heavenly. Then… cambios. However, I already knew my cambios. Weird
            right, here is the back story. On Wednesday, we were sitting there
            eating lunch when President Dyer told me he wanted to talk to me. He
            took me outside and started talking. He then asked me if I would be
            his new Financial Secretary. Well, I wasn’t going to say no, so he
            just said I would be heading there for the next cambio. Now do you get
            the title. It is from the Office, and now I will be working in the
            office of the mission. It was funny to me, but I have been in Bolivia
            for 11 months. Now there is good and bad for being secretary:<br><br>
            
            Bad:<br><br>
            
            I don’t get to work as much in the field<br><br>
            
            I am going to receive lots of calls from angry missionaries who don’t have money<br><br>
            
            Good:<br><br>
            
            I get my own corner office with a view of Cochabamba<br><br>
            
            I get my own phone<br><br>
            
            I get my own stamp with my name on it<br><br>
            
            I get to be with President Dyer when he finishes and I get to be there
            when President Hansen arrives<br><br>
            
            I have my own computer<br><br>
            
            I get to learn the behind the scenes stuff of the mission<br><br>
            
            Ya, so it is definitely going to be a huge change for me. Going from
            the poorest kind of area to the city working in the office. I will be
            there tomorrow morning. President Dyer said I should be there for 6
            months. It should be interesting. Those are the biggest happenings of
            this week. I know I am good at Spanish now, because as I type this
            there are a bunch of guys playing some online game here using
            basically every bad Spanish word that exists, and they offend me to
            hear them. I am almost 100% latino I think. I hope you guys are all
            doing well, and I have 11 months now, so I am old now. Love you guys,
            see you in 13 months.<br><br>
            
            Love,<br><br>
            
               Elder Bagley<br><br>
            
            Future Secretary of Finances

                        <p>Back to probably my last week in El Paso. Today was kinda boring. We got up and studied and stuff. For some reason, Muñoz got made at me. He had something of Elder Tiahin, and Tiahin told me to tell him to bring it. So, I asked if he had it, and he didn't answer, so I asked him later and he just looked at me and didn't respond. I asked if he was going to answer and he got mad. Guess I shouldn't ask a question twice. Anyways, then we had our zone meeting. The ZLs gave the lesson on obedience and a few other things. It was good enough. After that we had lunch, Muñoz slept for a bit, then we went to a couple lessons. First, we taught Indira and her family, minus Wilder. I guess Indira is living at her mom's house now. We talked about a lot of things, but Muñoz was just talking up a storm, and we ended up staying there for 2 1/2 hours. Everyone seems like they are doing well though. After that we talked to Wilson Andia and his family. We talked about prayer. Overall, kind of a boring day, not too exciting.</p>

                        <h3>May 14, 2014</h3>
                        <p>Well............... Today was a surprise. We got up today and had a service project. Us 4, along with the whole Quillacollo zone, and Pres and Hna Dyer. We went to Benita and Sonia's house and took out a bunch of dead plants, weeds, and stuff and basically cleaned the yard. The 4 of us in Jardin did a good job. Muñoz is like a pro with the machete. I got some blisters from working. I remember at the start of my mission, the missionaries from Santa Cruz, when grouped together, were a problem. Now, it is the Peruanos. A lot of them did nothing, but were first in line to eat. We were eating after, and I was talking to Elder Jarrell, Bennett, Rhoton, and Phillips and all of a sudden, Pres Dyer called me over and said he wanted to talk to me. We went out and he just started talking. Finally he asked me if I would be his new financial secretary. Well, that wasn't what I expected. I'm still not sure what to think about it. I get really dissappointed because I won't get to work too much, but it is kind of exciting cause it is a really big change. It's on my mind basically all the time, and I don't know what to think. Also, I'm not allowed to tell anyone, so it is just me thinking, and I can't talk it out. Uhhhhhhhh. Anyways, we talked to Gabriel later, and he is still hung up on the BoM. Can't figure out what his deal is. After that we visited the Flia Chavez in their new house. Firstly, Corina (daughter) touches us way too much and it makes me and Muñoz uncomfortable. We helped them move furniture upstairs, and although it was complicated, we got it done. My arms are sore though. Finally, we went to talked to Benito. He is all ready to go. We asked who he wanted to baptize him, and he, out of nowhere, said the bishop. Well that's just downright perfect. I'm really excited for him. Then we just ate dinner and went home. Oh yeah, we also found a headless giraffe doll in the street that should have some importance later. Overall, my mind is still stuck on the whole secretary thing.</p>

                        <h3>May 15, 2014</h3>
                        <p>After a very surprising day yesterday, today was kind of boring. We got up and studied and all that, and then had our weekly planning. It was weird doing it knowing I won't even be her next week. It was good. Really, even though we have had our ups and downs, but I have enjoyed these 3 months with Elder Muñoz. It's going to be kinda sad to have to leave him and El Paso. However, that is how the mission works. After lunch (where Joel and Eileen wouldn't let me go) we had our only lesson. It was Claudia in the Flia Chavez's new house. It started out normal, but doubts/questions/concerns/interesting things started surfacing. She is really great, and wants everything to be true, she just isn't sure yet. This next part is going to sound really stuck up, but it is what happened. Muñoz was just kinda rambling on trying to answer all of her questions at once, but I sat there thinking. Then I started asking questions. I definitely felt guided by the spirit. She said she'll pray, and I know she'll get an answer. After that, we went to the Barrio. Only 2 important things. Firstly, we saw Wilder and he just looks completely destroyed emotionally. We need a solution and fast. AFter that, we met Karla Ticona's mom and talked for a bit with her. Then we went to the chapel. We waited for a while. Good thing was that Rodrigo and Cristian came to play futsal. We talked to the bishop about Saturday and we are all ready. The bishop is a good guy. We went to the Flia Chavez's house later because they invited us over for pizza. Little did we know we'd have to wait an hour for it to be ready; actually, we should know better by now with them. Hna Chavez is now the seminary teacher for El Paso, so that is good. We got home at 11, which is really late, so I am tired. I'm still waiting for Pres Dyer to call me like he said he would, but we will sit here, waiting...</p>

                        <p>Well, today scared me a bit. In the morning I went with Elder Watts while Elder Tiahin came up here to do Benito's interview. With Watts, we went to go teach the 7_55. The plan was to teach Mauricio, but he is your prototypical child stay, grown up. He slept in till 12 and never came out of his room. We did talk to the drummer, Sebastian, and the keyboard player, Kike. It was a pretty basic lesson, but they were cool guys. The whole band lifestyle wouldn't be something for me. After the lesson, me and Watts started playing the piano and I think we impressed them all (Watts more than me) they said they'd fire the keyboard player and hire Watts. After that, we walked around looking for people, but their area is dead in the morning. We then went to lunch and then had a lesson with Claudia. She's doing well and even talked about baptism, so she's definitely not against it. She'll get baptized some day. After that, we went down to visit Ana Paula, but she wasn't there. So we went back up to the Flia Chavez's house to teach Ruth Pinto, this new lady. Actually, she's an old investigator, but new to us. She's cool and seems interested. After that, we had 3 appts planned at 7, but every single one fell through. Flia Andia (Wilson) wasn't there, neither were Michelle and Nicole, and Indira got home late, so there wasn't time. We talked to Nadir, but her mom doesn't want us to talk to her anymore. Then we ate cake with the Flia Chavez for Galilea's birthday, then went home. The scary part of the day was when Maribel called and told us that Benito told her the baptism was postponed. That scared me, but then we called Benito and he said he was telling that to Maribel so she wouldn't give him anything for his baptism. Weird, but he will be baptized tomorrow, so I have no need to worry now.</p>

                        <p>BBBBBBBAPTISM!!! Today was kinda a throw away day, except for the end. We woke up and did service for the Flia Chavez, lifting furniture up some stairs. After that we just went home. We ate lunch with the Flia Calle. The Hermana has a way cool story of her conversion. First, when she was younger, she had a dream about 2 people coming to her door, one in a blue shirt and one in a brown coat. She thought it might have meant something, but she ignored it. 11 yrs later, 2 missionaries knocked on her door, wearing a blue sweater and the other in a brown coat. Also, once her husband was in the hospital and his friend gave him a book from the church, but didn't tell him anything about the church. There was a random name written on the book, and like 10-15yrs later the name of the person on the book, that person became this Hermana's kids' seminary teacher. It's a good story. After that, random little kids asked me questions about english, and then we went to the chapel. The problem with this baptism (there's always a problem) was that we planned to do it with the ZL's baptism. But their person showed up late, so we just started without her. It was a good baptism. <u>Benito</u> will be a good member. He has all the desires in the world, he just needs help from the members. We ate a bunch of food after, and then just went home. I was so tired that I just collapsed and slept. Benito's Baptism, just rolls off the tongue. Today was good, there's nothing better than a baptism.</p>

                        <p>Kind of a boring day to be my last sunday here in El Paso. We went to church just like normal. We only had 1 investigator, Franco, who came to church. However, Benito showed up early for his confirmation. I received the priveledge of confirming him. I felt a lot more confident this time. I think it turned out well. After that, we ate lunch with the Flia Caballero. They are cool people and really animated to help out the misioneros. They are the kinda of people we need. Other that, the day was spent waiting for the cambios. We had to make some plans as well, to set up Jardin 3, cause hermanas are coming to the ward. I'm tired so my handwriting sucks. We had a lesson with the Flia Riveros, along with Jorge, Marcelo, and Pres Orellana. It was good enough. We saw something cool at church. We were doing role plays and Rosella could be a great missionary. As for cambios, I am going to the offieces, and Apaza to Potosi... It'll be an interesting change, but I'm excited for the chance to learn.</p>

                        <p>Can you tell how tired I was yesterday judging by how awful my handwriting is? Today was calm, until nighttime. We just had email, then we went to the center. We printed pictures and ate lunch at Luigi's. We just hung around and talked to some people, then we just went home. At 6 we were supposed to go to the Flia Chavez's, but they weren't home, so we went to see the bishop and pick up Apaza's baptism pants. After that we went to visit the Flia Nuñez. This is where everything got stressful. We were supposed to eat at 7, but we didn't start until 8:30 because it took a while to get the food out. Well, we had 3 other places to go, so that got me a little stressed. On top of that, Muñoz was just being annoying. He knew we had to leave, but he was just taking his sweet ole time, and everytime I would ask if we could go, he'd make a little smart aleckish comment, and that bothered me more. I've also always have the problem where I get heated up very quickly. well, after eating and leaving the appt, I kinda got mad at Muñoz. It was an uncomfortable walk to Benita's. There was just took a picture, picked up the food, then left to visit Maribel and Benito. It was good. Celestina made us anticucho. I hid the potatoes in my bag. I am tired of potatoes. I got rid of them very discretely (spelling?), I put them in my bag and pockets. On the way home, we talked to Benito and he told us he wants to go on a mission. WOOHOO!!! Finally, we talked with the Flia Chavez, then went home. I didn't get to bed until 4, cause of packing and stuff. Graaaaave había sido.</p>
