            <h1>Week 13 <small>(April 21, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>(no subject)</h3>
            <p><small>Dearest family,<br>
                This was actually a good week. I really dont have anything to
              complain about. First time in a while where we ended the week and
              everything just seemed good. Here is the breakdown, as there was
              actually a lot of things that happened, so I will do my best to
              remember everything.<br>
              - Activity on Monday<br>
                 I am sure you can see in the pictures that I will send, but we went
              to some old convent in Cochabamba and we also ate at the mission home.
              I hadnt been there since November. We ate sloppy joes, and played
              basketball (I really miss it). The convent was cool, but I still dont
              understand where a lot of the catholic traditions come from<br>
              -Temple Tuesday<br>
                 We went to the temple at 6 in the morning, meaning we had to leave
              El Paso at 5, so we woke up at 4. The temple is awesome. I didnt
              realize I much I had missed it, but I hadnt gone for almost 9 months.
              Also, I saw the Gilbert´s at the temple, so that was good to get my
              package. The temple is the best. We had a conference after, and it
              was...eh, not too exciting.<br>
              - Tramites<br>
                 Well, even though we had planned some lessons in the morning on
              Thursday, they called wednesday and said I had to do tramites. Pinta
              did too, so we did an intercambio where Muñoz went with Apaza and I
              went with Pinta like the good ole days. I am legal now, I have my ID
              and everything, until halloween of this year.<br>
              - Ward Mission meeting<br>
                 Finally, the ward decided to help us. We had a meeting with Jorge,
              Marcelo (high counsel guy, like Jorge´s best friend too), and Hno
              Cadima, the second counselor. It was a really effective meeting. They
              decided they needed to do something, so we are going to start working
              hard again with the ward. Hno Cadima even took time out of his
              schedule to come to lessons with us on Saturday<br>
              So those are the things that happened this week, now on to what is
              going on with the investigators<br><br>
              
              -Rosela<br>
                Not sure if I talked about her last week, but she is getting
              baptized on the 26th. She is so ready and wants to make the change in
              her life. We are so stinkin excited<br>
              - Rodrigo<br>
                 He is Rosela´s little brother. He wasnt really interested much, but
              when we got to church on Sunday, he came up and asked us if he can get
              baptized too. Well, that made us even more happy this week. He prayed
              and got his answer, so we will hopefully have 2 baptisms on Saturday.<br>
              - Nadir<br>
                 She is some girl that we found on the street one day when Hna
              chavez came with us. We went by on Wednesday, then on Friday, and
              again on Sunday. 3 lessons with her. She is one of the few people I
              have taught that reads everything and understands it. We went by for
              the second lesson and she explained the Restoration and how we can
              receive an answer to prayers, and then on Sunday she explained that
              the BoM is like the same idea as the Bible but from different
              prophets, that Mormon joined all the writings together, and then gave
              it to Moroni. Everytime we teach her we just smile cause she is a
              golden investigator so far.<br><br>
              
              Other investigators include:<br>
              Aydde and Gabriel- they are still doing well, but they were out of
              town this week. They just have the speed bump of the BoM, it is a big
              change for them.<br>
              Benito- He is the boyfriend/friend of a less active member. He came to
              church yesterday (without his girlfriend) and is just super humble<br>
              Nicole and Michelle- Nicole is a member, but Michelle no. They are 12
              and 10 and their aunt takes them to church, but the aunt was out of
              town. We taught about the Plan of Salvation and I drew it on a piece
              of paper to make it easier. They love us<br><br>
              
              So, it was a good week. We are seeing the miracles in El Paso, and are
              preparing more baptisms in 2 months than this area has seen in 2
              years. Living with Muñoz, Apaza, and Pinta is fun, and everytime we go
              to lunch we laugh so hard cause we are just stupid teenage age-ish
              boys. I hit 10months on Saturday, so the mission continues to go by
              really fast. Love you guys, got the package, and I will see you in 1
              month (Mother´s day)<br>
              Love,<br>
                Elder Bagley<br>

                      <p>Templte day!!! First time in Cocha and first time in 8 1/2 months to any temple. We got up at 4am and got to the temple at 5:45. It was better than I imagined. The temple is incredible inside, and it is just so peaceful. There's a new video too which made it a different experience. I miss going to the temple and going makes me want to do it a whole lot more when I get home. After that, I luckily found the Gilbert family who brought me a package from my family, then we took pictures. After we had a special conference. I was kinda tired, but it was good. I got to see Elder Christiansen and some other friends, and also Elder Feddock being the biggest chulpamedia ever, saying he'll find 7 nuevos on mondays. Elder Hernandez was there, didn't talk to me, and we around telling people (like Elder Bennett) that I yelled at him and all that, not sure what that kid's problem is. We had 2 lessons, with a lady named Anabel and then with Karen. Eh... just regular lessons. Overall, I'm tired, but still happy that I went to the temple.</p>

                    <p>I'll make this entry short and sweet. We started out the day with a lesson with this new girl, Nadir. She's basically a reference from the Flia Chavez. She's pretty cool, and understands well. Muñoz and I both think she'll be great. After that was zone meeting. It was good, and I got a package. We went to lunch, then home to "study". Well, that was the plan, but we ended up falling asleep. Not sure how, but we slept from 2-5. Repercussions from waking up at 4 yesterday. We did, however, have a lesson with Rosela and we are still good to go for next saturday. I really am so excited for the baptism. Other than that, not much happened. Benita still has this dog, Choco, which is stupid. It barks all the times and bites. We can't go in if it is outside. However, it was still a good enough day.</p>

                    <p>I'm legal! Today I went with Pinta because we both had to do tramites (still have no clue how to say that in english). I was able to pick up my Bolivian ID, so I'm legal till next halloween. I also got to talk to Elder Jerrell, Merejildo, and Hna torrico, friends from Sucre. Muñoz went with Apaza to teach Gabriel and Aydde, and it went well I guess. We got home at 10:30, then accidently fell asleep until 12. Our sleep schedule is completely off track right now. Stay up till 11:30, wake up at 5, stuff like that. We had a lesson with Hna Elsa. We talked about the temple and stuff and she got her recommend tonight, so we're all good for her. We also taught the Word of Wisdom to Rosela. At night, we had our meeting with Jorge. It actually started on time. Jorge tried to give us waska for being 8min late. better 8 than 90 like him, but oh well. It was a great meeting. Seems like we've rebooted the members and they wanna help. Especially Hno Cadima, the 2nd counselor. He wants to do everything he can to help us. We felt really good after the meeting, just hope they follow up on what they said. We got home at 10:30, which I hate, but it is hard to avoid sometimes. Overall, good enough day.</p>

                    <h3>April 18, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Today actually turned out pretty well. In the morning we had a lesson with Nadir. She read the pamphlet and everything and seems pretty interested. Not often here do the people actually read what we tell them. We have another appt on Sunday with her. We are really hoping she keeps progressing. After that we talked to Daniela Laime. She still... eh, but she is interested in the Holy Ghost and how it works. We made a small breakthrough at least. After lunch, we talked to Faviana Riveros. Her husband is in the hopsital and they have big financial problems too. We should be going by tomorrow with the leaders to see how to help. After that, we finally got a hold of Marisol Menesez. She's one of those inactives that was offended by members. I think she knows it is true, but she said she has an "espina" (thorn, spine) that keeps her from coming back. Finally, we taught Michelle and Nicole about the Plan of Salvation. It was a good lesson, the only thing stopping them is they can only go to church when their aunt goes, so with their aunt out of town it makes it hard. They really like us though, and the church, so we'll get them eventually. Oh ya, at lunch, there was some Bible crazy tv show on where some guy prayed for 30min with background music, crying, people falling to the ground and everything. It made us luagh. Muñoz has been up and down lately. Sometimes he's super happy, but other times it seems like he hates me. The kid is a rollercoaster. Oh well, he's still good. Overall, good day.</p>

                    <h3>April 19, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Today was normal. We got up (me at 7, Muñoz at 9) and then left at 11:30. Not sure why, but it seemed like Muñoz was mad, so I just followed cause I'm tired of arguing. Well, we accomplish nothing, didn't talk, then went to lunch. However, at lunch he was fine, we were all laughing (even Hno and Hna Choque) and all that. The kid is up and down. Me and Apza had fun playing soccer very poorly. After lunch, we went and talked to Benito, Maribel, Ana Paula, and Celestina. Ana Paula really wants to come to church, and Benito has questions, so we're making progress. They both promised to come to church. Later, we met up with Hno. Cadima and went to visit the Flia Nuñez. It was a good visit, Hno Cadima is how a church leader should be, he actually wants to help us. After we left, we saw so much lightning. Every 5 seconds there was some. I'm not a big fan of weather to say the least. We went and talked to the Flia Riveros after. The other day Hno Jhony Riveros, had to go to the hospital and have an operation. They don't have insurance, and it costs 3475bs, or like $500, and don't have the money, so supposedly Jorge and Pres Orellana were helping in that. It was an interesting day, but I have 10 months now, so it is all good.</p>

                    <h3>April 20, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Today was a good day. We got up and went to pick up people. I went with Dennis Roger. Really, we only had 1 success, Benito, but still, it's a success. Muñoz got the whole Flia Nuñez to come, so that was good. At church we had good success. We introduced the Flia Nuñez and Benito to the leaders and all that. Then... the best part. Muñoz called me over and told me Rodrigo wanted to tell me something. I guess he got his answer and he wants to be baptized. Well, that made us very happy. We're going to try hard to get him baptized on Saturday as well. WOOHOO!!! At the end of church, me, Pinta, Jorge, and this other dude went to get Hno Riberos out of the hospital. We paid, but we can't get him out on a Sunday. Hospitals are like prisons here. After that, we ate with the Flia Tudela (There are like 5 families that are Tudelas. We had 2 lessons, both of which Andrea Orellana came with us. First we talked to the Flia Nuñez. We are going to push hard to get Rodrigo baptized on Saturday, but I think it is possible. They both are prepared for baptism. After that, we taught Nadir. She always keeps her commitments , it is great. First time I've taught someone that does everything, every time. We are feeling really good about her. Overall, good day, every single one of our numbers went up, so we're happy.</p>

                    <p>P-da...y? Today was good. We were scared there'd be a blockeo (Bolivians love blockeos like Americans love baseball), but luckily there wasn't. We had internet, which was good, Griff should be getting his call soon, so I'm excited. After that, we went to TGI Fridays (exists for some reason). It was so tronki. They play american music, put baseball and the Office on TV, and the food is good ole american food. I got a big bacon cheeseburger, and onion rings. Whew, that filled me up a lot. It was a good experience, but I need to order less food. After that we printed off picutres and stuff, I bought a new wallet, then we went home. At night, we taught Rodrigo. It is such a change from before, he understands everything and wants to learn everything. The spirit really changes people. Overall, good day, back to the everyday mission life now.</p>
