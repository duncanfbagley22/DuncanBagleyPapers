            <h1>Week 12 <small>(April 14, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>The good, the bad, and the ugly</h3>
            <p><small>Dearest family<br>
                This was really the week with the highest of highs, and not the
             lowest of lows, but there were bad parts. However, I think the highs
             out weigh the lows, so that is good. Sometimes it just seems like the
             Lord just tries to gives us the lows so that the highs are even
             better. Anyways, this is what happened.<br><br>
             
             the good:<br>
             I would rather focus on the good, so this is what good happened this
             week. We have 4 investigators that are doing well. First off are Aydde
             and Gabriel. We had a lesson on Wednesday and Sunday with them. Their
             problem is the Book of Mormon. They still have a lot of problems
             accepting it, not so much accepting it, but figuring out why it is
             necessary. We have been trying every way, but the only way to find
             something out is to pray. They know it, but just cant get past a few
             doubts. We have a lesson at 6:30am on Thursday, cause they didnt have
             any other possible time.<br>
             We also have a family named the Flia Nuñez. The grandma is a member,
             and we have basically reactivated her. She has 4 grandkids that live
             there. 2 arent that interested, but the older sister Rosella, and the
             youngest brother Franco, are doing well. A week or so ago, we told
             Rosella to pray and ask. She said she had done it, and nothing
             happened. However, we went back yesterday and she just said that she
             had had some problems, and when she prayed again she felt so much
             peace and that now she really wants to get baptized. Franco is 8 and
             has read up to Mosiah all by himself. The baptismal date is for April
             26th, so hopefully we get there<br><br>
             
             the bad:<br>
             I had a bad headache on tuesday. I never have headaches, but this one
             came out of nowhere. I got home and just went to sleep cause I couldnt
             deal with it anymore. I didnt like it.<br><br>
             
             the ugly:<br>
             Friday was our big concert activity. We had to get to the chapel at 8
             to set up the stage... but Jorge didnt show up until 10 to do the
             work. Then, we worked until 1 when Jorge told us to cancel lunch and
             he would buy it. Then from 2-4 we waited for Jorge to bring lunch in
             "20 minutes". We werent very happy with him. At night was the concert,
             which started an hour late, so a lot of people left. Elder Hernandez
             showed up for some reason, and later his comp found out they didnt
             have permission. Hernandez just became mad at everyone and left. So
             mad, he sent me a text at night. Muñoz read it to me, and it said
             things like he was wrong to think I was a good missionary. I just
             looked at Muñoz, Apaza, and Pinta just so confused cause I didnt even
             talk to Hernandez. He is an interesting one to say the least. I dont
             feel bad, I didnt even do anything. On Sunday, we tried to talk to
             Jorge about the ward not helping, not having ward counsel, and
             basically inactivating our members. Somehow, he tried to make it my
             fault cause there is no support. Apparently it is my fault that home
             teaching doesnt happen and stuff like that. He was laying it on me
             pretty hard, but Apaza just stopped him and said it is opposite of
             that. Something about Bolivians is that they look for the problem in
             others, but never realize that they have things to fix.<br><br>
             
             There you have it, the good, the bad, and the ugly. I dont feel bad
             about anything, as I am actually doing my part, while Hernandez and
             Jorge and people like that just want others to do everything. This
             week should be good, as we are going to the temple tomorrow morning as
             a mission. Love you guys so much, and keep send those prayers this
             way.<br>
               love,<br>
                Elder Bagley

                      <p>Basically the start of cambio #8 in the mission. It goes really fast. Today we woke up, studied, then went to work at 11, cause Muñoz isn't in his training anymore. We went to Pandoja, which is way out there. We did find where the one member lives though, so mission accomplished. We had to wait forever for a trufi to get to El Paso, and we got the dirtiest trufi in the world. We took a little nap after lunch, then we had 2 lessons. First we taught this lady named Eva. She is cool, a little slow understanding, but cool. She is really interested in the Relief Society, so that might help. After that we taught Rosella from Flia Nuñez. She actually is trying to find out if it is true. We put a baptism date for the 26th, so we're gonna get working harder. After that I gave 3 baptismal interviews. First to a cool guy named Juan. He really really wants to get baptized and is convinced it is the true church. Also his future wife named Nancy. She is basically the same as him. They're an interesting couple, but they'll be strong members. Finally, Micaela... She's good, but super duper shy, so it was a challenge at times, but everything turned out ok. It was a good enough day. We have been passing out invitations for the concert, and when we got on the trufi we gave 2 to some very flirty girls aka snkaes. Flirt to convert. Hasta mañanits.</p>

                    <h3>April 9, 2014</h3>
                    <p>I'll just get to it. We started out with our district meeting. I kinda taught my class, but we more talked about our investigators. That wasn't really my plan, it just kinda happen. We have Elder Galan in our district now. I liked Edmonds better, but Galan is ok. After that, Jorge came to explain the concert on friday. They're planning it huge, we are even going to have security guards. After lunch, we taught 2 lessons. First, we taught Aydde and Gabriel. It was a good lesson, and they are interested, just that there are some hurdles, but we are working on it. We always have really long lessons with them, so after I told Muñoz he needs to shut up a bit... He doesn't like when I critique him. After that, we taught Benito. We got there and Celestina offered us "comidita". We thought it'd be small, but she brought out a big ole bowl of lamb soup. We ate, taught about prayer (Benito is a potential baptism) and then went to dinner. We couldn't finish cause we were so full before. I also had a huge headache, so when we got home I had to go straight to bed cause it hurt so much. Muñoz gave me crap because I said "tosear" instead of "toser" which means "to cough", I just spoke english after that. Good day, but my head hurts.</p>

                    <p>I'm kinda behind on my journal, but I will sum up today quickly. We had 3 lessons today. First, we talked to Alejandro Cabrera. He's a recent convert/less active. He actually has a good testimony, he's a little different, but he's good. After that we talked to Indira. She is the daughter of Hna Elsa, and very inactive. She never really had a tesitmony, so we taught about why that's important. She didn't seem too interested. Finally, we taught Rosenilda, Hna Andia's wife. She's cool, just doesn't really like the BoM (even though she named her son Nefi). Hopefully with the ward's help they'll get going. We literally went to every house we know of in the Barrio today, will small success. We had a "meeting" with Jorge, but nothing really happened. Good enough, average day.</p>

                    <h3>April 11, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Concert day... All the hype for the "greatest activity ever". This what happened...
                        <br>We supposedly needed to be at the chapel at 8. We got there 8:30, and nothing really happened until 10. We got salteñas though, so it was ok. From 10-12, we were supposed to teach Rosella, but everytime I got changed into my shirt and tie, she'd call and say she'd be there later, so I had to change in and out of my clothes 3 times today. Then we did service, setting up the stage for the 7_55. There was some heavy stuff. First, me and Elder Loson went with the lead singer Mauricio to go pick up the base for the stage. Mauricio is a pretty cool guy. He's only 18, but still relatively down to earth. The band name comes from the fact that Mauricio became famous really young, so he arrived early (like 7:55 instead of 8). He also said it involves some weird dream someone had, but I don't remember. After setting up everything, Jorge said he'd bring lunch, so we sat and waited for "20 minutes" or more like 2 hrs. Everyone was so annoyed with Jorge after that. We got home, then came down in an empty bus to the church. We also went to pick up some teenage security guards. There was a moderate amount of people there, but a bunch left cause it didn't start till an hour later than expected. We only got to hear one song before leaving. Elder Hernandez was there. He told his comp they had permission to come, even though they obviously didn't. His ZLs got mad, and he in turn got mad at everyone else. He sent me a nasty text about how he was wrong to think I was a good missionary. I still have no idea what I did, I didn't even talk to him at all. Oh well, it's his problem, I can't feel bad about not doing anything wrong. We were cranky after cause we wasted the whole day and didn't even get to watch it. Oh well, que siga adelante Elder.

                    <h3>April 12, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Not much really happened today. In the morning, Apaza and Pinta went to the chapel to help Jorge, who never showed up. We had lunch with the Flia Caballero. They're a pretty cool family, what members should be like. We had a good time, talking about Apaza being a Yajuero, and trying to not laugh when the grandma was telling a weird story. After that, we had one lesson. We talked with Hna Elsa and she is great. She constantly shares her testimony with us and is a good member, she just needs to be a bit more active in the church. Finally, at night we had a bit of a problem with Muñoz. This girl from his old area called and he was talking for like 30 minutes. When I call him out on it, he tries to make it my fault. He's very self-centered, as in he always finds the faults in others, but never can see his own. I guess we'll just keep trying with him.</p>

                    <h3>April 13, 2014</h3>
                    <p>Sundays are where the magic happens. We went to church, but we had zero investigators come. After church we had a special meeting with Jorge. We tried to tell him we need help in the ward and we are working solos, but then Jorge just turned everything on me. How I need to step up and make it happen and all that, then Apaza had my back and just told Jorge he is wrong. I don't get his problem. Everything from Home Teaching not being done to not having ward counsel is our fault. We didn't make too much progress with the meeting. We had lunch with the Flia Tudela Gutierrez, and it took me forever to finish. We had a lesson with Aydde and Gabriel. Hna Andrea Orellana came with us to help. They are still caught up with the Book of Mormon. We told them to open up their hearts and try to see if it is true. We are trying so hard that our next lesson is at 6:30am on Thursday. Finally, best part, we taught the Flia Nuñez. We talked for a bit, a finally Rosella told us she wants to be baptized. She was having problems and praying for the truth brought so much peace she knew it was true. April 26th, and hopefully Franco can get in on it too. We were so happy after the lesson. Overall, the day started out poorly, but finished well.</p>

                    <p>P-day to brownnose/suck the socks. Went to internet which was good enough. We only got 1:10min because Muñoz took forever to get ready. Griff's papers are in, so now we just wait for the call. After that we went and ate lunch at the mission home, sloppy joes. It was fun, I just hung with Elder Watts and Olson. After that we went to see this old convent in the city. It was cool, but I see all the problems with their doctrine. I also found out Olson loves Disneyland like I do. At night we met with Wilder Andia, a less active. He has desires to come back, but says he lacks the faith. He's cool though. We also found out that there is fighting between El Barrio and Pansoja, so people need to guard their land. It's like a civil war I guess. This should be an interesting week, and hopefully good.</p>
