            <h1>Week 15 <small>(May 5, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Just another week</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family who I will be talking to this Sunday,<br>
                How is everything back home? Things here just keep moving on. This
             week just kinda passed by and before I realized it was already over.
             Not too exciting this week. Just one of those weeks that just happens.
             I will try to think of the goods things that happened this week. There
             is a few good things that happened though...<br>
             1) Benito- Benito is this 18 year old kid we have known for about a
             month. We met him going to visit a less active and he just happened to
             be there, so we talked to him too. At first, he just seemed like a
             regular Bolivian, or just didnt really understand. However, he came to
             church about 2 weeks ago, then he came to the baptism too. We went by
             to teach him Wednesday morning and we were planning on talking about
             baptism. We thought he would accept, but we didnt think it would be so
             easy. He explained to us that he received his answer and he wanted to
             be baptized. We invited him to be baptized on the 17th, but he said he
             couldnt because he didnt have enough money to plan a baptism. When we
             told him we would take care of everything, he accepted and will
             hopefully be baptized on the 17th. He came to church yesterday too.<br>
             2) Rosella and Rodrigo- They are doing well. They come to church and
             do all that. Rodrigo has his interview on Thursday for the priesthood,
             and Rosella told us yesterday that she signed up for institute. She is
             taking mission prep, so that is really really good. They are good
             converts<br>
             3) Flia Andia- This is a family of a guy that has been inactive for 20
             years, his wife who has been inactive for 7 years, and their kids. We
             have been focusing on them this week. We have talked a lot about the
             family and all that, and they are progressing well. The husband came
             to church on sunday and the wife is looking for a job where she wont
             have to work on sundays. They are doing really well.<br>
             Other than that, this week has been kind of boring. We havent been too
             focused for some reason, so I am trying to figure out how to fix that.
             We need to find a lot more investigators. I am so ready to call for
             mother´s day, it is going to be awesome. It will probably be around 4
             or 5 Bolivian time, so at like 2 or 3 for you guys. I wont be able to
             call beforehand, so I will probably just send an email or something on
             Sunday to tell you what time for sure. Just make sure that everyone is
             there. I love you guys so much, and I cant wait to see you on Sunday.<br>
               Love,<br>
                 Elder Bagley</small></p>

                        <p>Well, I redeemed myself for the awful class last week. Today I taught about trust. We showed up late, because of a blockeo, but we got there and had a good lesson. We have to trust the Lord, the Spirit, our companions, and ourselves. We also have to ask ourselves if the Lord can trust us. I felt really good about it, but it was because I prepared this time. After lunch we just had 2 lessons. We contacted a bunch of people, but no one was really interested. We did have a good lesson with the Flia Andia. Wilder seems to really have desires to return, which is good. We taught about prayer and all that. After that we talked to the Flia Nuñez for a second and then talked to the Flia Riveros about what they've learned for all their trials. Everything was good, except we got to dinner and stomach started hurting a lot. It was like bloated or full of air, but I could hardly eat. It woke me up 2 times at night, cause it hurt so much. I don't like being sick, but it comes with the calling I guess.</p>

                        <p>And... there goes April. It's already May basically, that's crazy. Today I had to go do tramites with Elder Muñoz. I'm done, but he had to go do a bunch of stuff. It was boring, but I got to see Elder Singer, my friend from Sucre who I hadn't seen for 5 months, other than that it was boring. We hurried back to El Paso because we had a lesson with Nadir. She is still doing well, understands everything, and we even put a date for May 24th for a baptism. We'll push hard to get that date. She is a great investigator though. After lunch, we went home to study, and for basically 30min we prepared for our lesson with Aidee and Gabriel. We had like 8 scriptures, and we were so ready to invite them to pray on the spot to receive and answer, but when we got there they doubted so much that we knew it wouldn't work. Not sure what happened, but they just don't really have the desire anymore. Aidee even brought out a scripture that talked about false prophets. She didn't say we were false prophets, but there is so much doubt in them that they aren't willing to keep compromises. It's hard, but me and Muñoz decided if we go back next time and they still doubt so much, we'll drop them until they decide to try to learn more. After that, we went to talk to the Flia Rojas (Maribel/Celestina) and Benito. They are doing well. Sometimes we have to explain things a few times, but Benito is progressing. He was curious about a lot of things, including baptism. We also met 2 new people there, Paulino and his daughter Lizeth. They're catholic, shocker, but they accepted a return appt, so there could be something. Other than that, we ate chicken heart for dinner (not too bad) and receive a weird text saying some girl named Jhassie has been watching us. Other than that, it is time to start May.</p>

                        <p>Wow, it's already May. That was really fast. Today was... eh. Not sure what's going on with my comp, but it is like he doesn't want to do anything anymore. He work up at 9:30, didn't do anything in the morning except watch movies, and then slept for another hour after lunch. It is really starting to frustrate me, cause I can't talk to him about it cause he just gets mad. We had a good lesson with the family of Wilder Andia. We talked about anchors in our lives, how the gospel will give us a sure anchor to keep us stable in life. Wilder is progressing well. Indira, his wife, is still leaning towards the catholic church, but she'll come over eventually. After that we talked to the Flia Nuñez. It was good, they should stay active. We were supposed to leave at 7, but Muñoz wouldn't leave, so we only left at <u>8</u>. It is frustrating, because he doesn't respect me at all. I'm just tired of it, plain and simple. We missed our meeting all together, so that made it worse. We got to dinner, and I just couldn't eat. I have been sick this week. I'm not sure what it is, but earlier my stomach hurt so much I couldn't sleep, and now I don't want to eat anything. Hopefully I get better soon. We aren't going to plan tonight, cause Muñoz is watching a movie. I also gave a baptismal interview for an investigator of Hna Gardiner and Hna Nieves. Not an <u>awful</u> day, but there are better.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>Today went by very quickly. We had a lesson with Benito at 11, and that was the best part of the day. We talked to him for a bit, and tried to put a date for May 17th. He said he couldn't... because he doesn't have money to buy the cake for the baptism. We explained that the ward takes care of it. After clarifying (?) that, he accepted the date and will be baptismed. He wants to and has received his answer so he knows it is true. We are excited. After that we talked to Hna Chavez and we have service with them tomorrow to help them move. We aren't allow to tell anyone though. We also taught this kid, Rodrigo, who lives downstairs. He's cool, knows a lot already, but doesn't wanna talk about baptism for a while. After that, I interviewed one of Cruz's investigators, then we went back and taught Benito again, basically answering quesitons. He seems really prepared. Bolivian news is awful. Today they showed that kids are wearing coats because it is cold, and there is a potato sale on Monday. Bolivian is such an interesting place, but it is so weird. Only in Bolivia is a phrase I use a lot.</p>

It was supposed to be service, but when we got there they (Flia Chavez) decided that they were going to postpone it for later, so we ended up just talking about soccer and waiting for them to cook lunch. We left at like 4:30 cause everything took a long time, and then we had to wait for our laundry and all that. Well, we went home, showered, and then left at 6. Basically, 2 good things happened. First, we met Nicole and Michelle's mom by helping her carry a bag. We didn't teach her, but we'll have a connection now, so it is a progress. We also talked to the Flia Nuñez grandkids, or Rosella, Rodrigo, Cristian, France, Andrea, Belen. We played a game with them and only that. We played way too long, and when Muñoz's team lost the first game, he had to play again to win. I just started calling people for Sunday, so I didn't play. We got home at 10:30, so that wasn't fun. However, we gained their confidence, mostly Andrea and Belen, so it was worth something. Kinda a wasteful day... oh well.</p>

                        <p>Today was pretty good I guess. We woke up and split off to pickup people and go to ward council (not sure how to spell council). I went to ward council with Israel. It was good, we didn't really get to talk about our stuff, but at least we had it. The bus came to church pretty full, so that was good. Rosella, Rodrigo, and Franco all came, also Benito. I kinda got mad at Muñoz during sacrament meeting cause he was being distracting and then wouldn't listen to me. He should listen, but I shouldn't have gotten mad. Church was good. In EQ we watched a movie that had the background music of "One Day" by Matisyahu. That made me a little tronki. After church we had good news. We were talking to rosella and she told us she signed up for institute, in the mission prep class. This should keep her active. After church wee went to eat lunch with the Flia Tudela. We had chuño, but lunch was good enough. After lunch, we passed by Nadir for a second. Her mom is a difficult person. She is the only speedbump for Nadir from keeping all the compromises, but her mom is a BIG speedbump. We'll gradually work with her. Then we passed by the Flia Nuñez, ate dinner, and went home. I had a nice long talk with Elder Watts. I'm really tired of being called a gringo and living with 3 latinos that always gang-up on me. I can't win anything here and no one respects me. Me and Watts just talked about how Peruvians are annoying and that the USA is the best country. I'd be going to play basketball tomorrow, but I'm to scared to ask Muñoz. Oh well, 2 weeks.</p>

                        <p>Pidai. Today was just kind of relaxing. Internet was just normal, nothing special. After that we had the plan of going to the "Parque Mariscal Santa Cruz", but when we got there it was closed. So much for me planning a p-day. After that failure, we went with Cruz, Galan, Tiahin, Watts, Olson, and Rueda to IC Norte, a super market that also has a food court. I ate a pizza cone, which was a new experience. I bought some batteries and detergent, then we just went home. I washed clothes and listened to some talks I downloaded by Elder Holland. We left finally and didn't really have any plans, so we just contacted. We found this cool family (Flia Mejia) and this girl named Talia, who both seem ready to hear the message. Me and Muñoz talked and we both think we need to be more focused this week and we are going to push each other to be more obedient. I am excited for this week, it should be a good one.</p>
