            <h1>Week 14 <small>(April 28, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>NO WAY, Griffin is going to Ecuador!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h3>
            <p><small>Dearest family,<br>
                Well, this was a good week. Just one thing I wanna say before I
             start... NO WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am so stinkin
             excited that Griffin is going to Ecuador. We will be just like 6 hours
             away in plane. We will speak spanish and all that. We can come pick
             him up after and go visit all the missions. Oh man, it is perfect.
             WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Ya, ok, not to be selfish,
             but now I will explain what happened this week with me in Bolivia.<br><br>
             
             Monday- The only thing we did was go to TGI Fridays. It was great to
             eat pure american food. It was expensive, for Bolivia, but eating
             onion rings made it worth it. However, the had baseball and The Office
             on TV and they play american music. The one I remember is Talk a Walk
             by Passion Pit I think it is.<br>
             Tuesday to Friday- Cant really remember any specifics. We were running
             around teaching lessons, waking up at 5 30 to teach a lesson to people
             that could only meet at 6 30, not sleeping a lot. It was just normal,
             but it went slow for some reason. We taught Rodrigo every day to get
             ready for Saturday.<br>
             Saturday- in the morning, me and Elder Apaza went to clean the church
             and fill up the font. It was so dirty, but we spent all morning and
             got it done. Our appts fell through, so the only thing after that
             was... The Baptisms!!! We had the baptisms for Rosella and Rodrigo and
             it was awesome. I baptized Rosella and Muñoz baptized Rodrigo (then on
             sunday we switched for the confirmations). We had like 40 people come
             to the baptism, and even had 7 investigators there. They were so happy
             afterwards and they should make great members.<br>
             Sunday- We had the confirmations. The first time I have ever confirmed
             someone, but I did alright. They both showed up all dressed up for
             church, like skirt for Rosella and shirt and tie for Rodrigo.
             Interesting cause they told us they would never do that. They are just
             awesome. After church we had a special meeting at night. Our bishop
             called like 18 ward missionary (young men, young women, YSA, and even
             2 couple missionaries). We had a fireside to set it up. Me and Elder
             Apaza talked about how to work with the members and stuff, then the
             bishop, Jorge, and the stake presidency spoke. The missionaries have
             weekly goals, they have little folders for everything, and the ward
             even made nametags that say Misionero de Barrio Jardin. It is a
             program that I have never seen before, but it should help us out a
             lot. Benita (our pensionista) even made dinner for everyone. These 2
             baptisms we just had are results from ward missionaries. This kid
             named Alejandro showed up where they lived and we would never have
             found them without him. This is a program I want to implement for the
             rest of my mission.<br>
             Well, that is the basics of this week. It is great to see the progress
             of Rosella and Rodrigo. We found them on Muñozs first day here and
             after 2 months of battling, the spirit worked on them and now they are
             members. Seeing the transformation is what really makes the mission
             worth it. Crazy that May is almost here, it passes so fast out here.
             Love you guys so much, and I guess I will talk to you in person on
             Saturday, May 10th (I guess that is the plan for Skype). Love you all,
             excited that we will have another Elder Bagley in South America, talk
             to you next week.<br>
               Love,<br>
                 The one and only Elder Bagley until august</small></p>

                        <p>Well, I probably had my worst district class today. I didn{t have lots of time to prepare and it just didn't turn out well. Elder Cruz helped save me, and it ended up with something good at the end. I'm already tired of teaching classes as DL. We had a lesson with Rodrigo in the morning. He's doing really well for his baptism. He's made a huge change, the Spirit really works on him. After lunch, we talked with Wilder Andia and his family. We talked about the Family Proclamation. It was good and you can see that the family wants to be active again. After that, we showed up late to the Plaza, but we went with Andrea Orellana to teach Aydde. She's so close, but the answer hasn't come. I think she knows it is true. After that, we had a meeting with Jorge to plan for Sunday, and then went home. Muñoz is mad for who knows why, but I've just decided to let him win. It has always better to be more or less good, than try and solve everything, because it always been worse trying to solve it, because it explodes later. Good enough day, but I'm so tired that this entry might be unlegible.</p>

                        <p>This week, and the last one, have been really good. Today was good as well. Muñoz always wakes up cranky, but once we have a lesson it is all good. We started out with a lesson with Rodrigo. Everything is still going well, ready for Saturday. He's a little nervous, but that's normal. After lunch, we had 3 lessons. First, we taught Rosela tithing and she's good to go as well. She really is converted, it is awesome. After that, we went with Hna Andrea Orellana to visit Aydde and Gabriel. I personally feel like Aydde knows it is true, but is a little scared. Gabriel is just confused and doubts too much. We are trying to figure out what to do, but it is puzzling. Finally, we taught Benito. He's a really humble guy, and he liked church, and wants to go again. He interest is helping Maribel get a little more active and itnerested as well. Overall, it was a good day, can't complain.<br><br></p>

                        <p>Today we finished up with Rodrigo, he's got the lessons, and he's ready. He is still nervous, but once everything happens, it'll all be good. After him we went to go see Nadir again. She only read a little, but she understood perfectly and explained the first half of 1 Ne 2 to us. I really do feel like she is a future member, just need to get her to church. Me and Muñoz always get so happy talking to her, just cause she is so interested. In the afternoon, we had a lesson with this girl we contacted in the street about a week ago, Claudia. We went to the house of the Flia Chavez to teach her and it went great. She understands and is interested to find out if it is the true church. She also wants to go to church. At night we had a meeting with Jorge, everything is set up for Saturday. Everything is going according to plan. 2 more days till the baptism, woohoo!</p>

                        <p>Today went fast. We started with an early lesson, at 6:30am will Gabriel and Aydde. For some reason we have no breakthrough, but we'll get there. After that we went to the baptism interviews, for Rosella and Rodrigo. Everything turned out well (Elder Watts made the funniest face when he saw Rosella) and we are good go for tomorrow. We also climbed a tree to pick fruit. After lunch, Muñoz slept, and slept, and slept until 4. He must've been really tired. We went home and planned after, but we mostly just talked about BYU. We taught Benito at night and it went great. When I bore witness of the first vision, I could feel the spirit so strong I almost cried. We'll get him going to baptism soon. At dinner, I did magic for Joel or more like I tricked him to think I did it. Things like filling up a glass without touching it (just made him close his eyes then I filled it up) and "waking" up Muñoz and making him "sleep" (he just acted). Joel was so impressed. Overall, fast day, ready for baptism.<br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>WOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO!!! Today we had the baptisms of Rosella and Rodrigo. In the morning, Apaza and I went to the church to clean it and fill the font. It was awful, the church was so messy, and there were hardly any brooms or things like that. It took all morning, but we got it clean enough. We ate lunch with the Flia Chavez (Dana tickled me and Muñoz, it was very uncomfortable). Then we went back to set things up. We got it all set up, then waited. Rodrigo showed up on time, and Malena (who was another girl that got baptized), but Rosella showed up like 20 min late. I may have been a little stressed. However, she got there (we also had 7 investigators there, so that was good. Even Ana Paula and Celestina came). It was a great baptism, lots of people showed up, and Rosella and Rodrigo will be good members. They both shared their testimonies and all that. Just seeing them so happy after makes the mission worth it. It was a long day, but these are the days that make the sacrifice worth it.</p>

                        <p>Well, baptism is important, but it isn't worth anything without the conformation. We had to make sure that Rosella and Rodrigo came today... they did, Rosella came in a skirt (she said she would never do that) and Rodrigo in a shirt and tie. That is just an awesome sight to see. Church was good enough after that. I confirmed Rodrigo and Muñoz confirmed Rosella. Muñoz was nervous to do it, and didn't really know how at first, but it all turned out ok. After church we went to Benita's and ate lunch. They made a BBQ and it was awesome, but we were so full. Literally, yucca is like my favorite food. After that, we went home, I accidentally fell asleep for 30min, then we went to the chapel for our "Primer Seminario de misioneros de Barrio Jardin". It actually turned out really well. We have a bunch of people called as ward missionaries, and this should help a lot. They should all be excited to work now, they have name tags, folders, and everything. There is this guy, Ricardo Jimenez, who is just visiting for a month, but he is a stud, and helps us out a lot. Also, we met this girl that came back from her mission early for health, Hna Serrano, and she is pretty cool too, but hearing Portuguese makes me thankful for spanish (she served in Brazil) The mission goggles are a real thing. Overall, it was a good day. The converts are active, the ward is helping, tomorrow is p-day, life is good.</p>

                        <p>P-day, holy p-day. Today was important, because Griffin got his mission call. He is going to the Ecuador Guayaquil Norte mission, and he leaves August 13th. It is cool that he will be going to the same country where my dad served and we'll all speak spanish. I am really excited for him. After internet, we went to play soccer. We played actual soccer for the first time on my mission, and it brought back so many memories. Sure the field was dead grass, rocks, and dirt, but it was still fun. After we were so tired though. We came home and just collapsed. I woke up, started washing clothes, and I started talking to this kid Rodrigo that lives downstairs. He has lots of problems and questions, and he accepted the invitation to talk to us on Friday. Could be a potential baptism. Overall, a good day, but after all we did I'm so tired.</p>
