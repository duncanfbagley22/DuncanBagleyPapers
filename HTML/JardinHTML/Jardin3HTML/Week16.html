            <h1>Week 16 <small>(May 12, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Dia de la Madre</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
                First of all, it was great to hear from you guys yesterday. It is
             weird that the next time I talk to you, Griffin will be on a mission
             and we will have to talk from the USA, Ecuador, and Bolivia on
             Christmas. Seems like you guys are doing great and that makes me
             happy. If I dont have to worry about anything at home, I can focus
             better on the mission. Maybe you guys could see a difference, but I am
             a better missionary now than 5 months ago. Keep being good and all
             that stuff.<br>
             Well, I am brainstorming to find out what I want to tell you guys
             about this week. It was a quick week and basically we had 5 days of
             work, cause 1 was pday and the other one I called you guys. I will
             classify everything into 3 categories, good, normal, and bad. First
             with the good<br>
             Good<br>
             -We are all ready for Benito´s baptism on Saturday. He is praying and
             reading and stuff, and he has been to church more than the required 3
             times for a baptism. We have a lesson with him later tonight where we
             will do is preinterview and then he will be ready for the interview
             and the actual baptism<br>
             -We had 4 investigators at church. We had Benito, then Aidee (truth
             is, I have no idea how to spell it, but it is eye-day), Claudia (this
             girl we found a few weeks ago), and Michelle (this 10 year old niece
             of a less active). We were happy about that. We also had the 2
             converts, Hna Elsa (we "rescued" her a few weeks ago), and 3 less
             actives. It was a successful Sunday.<br>
             - We had a brief meeting with the bishop and we are really doing well
             with the ward right now. The bishop told us he doesnt really like the
             other 2 elders. Maybe not that he doesnt like them, but he thinks they
             are lazy (which they are). He said he is excited to keep working with
             us. He told us that Rosella had an interview the other day to get to
             know him and she has had a rough past. Things have happened that me
             and Muñoz arent at liberty to tell people, but hopefully the gospel
             has helped change her. The bishop thinks is has. We also are doing
             well with the YW pres, YM pres, high priest group leader, and RS pres.
             Even though we live far away, will are still working with the ward.<br>
             -Exchanges. I went to Colcapirhua to work with Elder Galan from Peru,
             and Elder Cruz from Guatemala came to work with Muñoz. We both had
             successful days and learned a lot.<br>
             Normal<br>
             -There are transfers next week, and I could possibly leave.<br>
             -There isnt really anything else<br>
             Bad<br>
             -So our shower head was really bad and shooting in every direction but
             down, so naturally Elder Muñoz cleaned out the head and it was
             supposed to shoot straight down. Well, there is no pressure, so the
             water just all drains to the middle and comes down in one stream. It
             is hard to shower.<br>
             -Blockeo, the reaction of Bolivians anytime there is something they
             dont like, they go protest in the street and cars cant pass. Well,
             that is a problem when we live 3.5 miles away from anything. We took a
             trufi (little van/bus), and it took a back route. That back route took
             40 minutes for a regular 20 minute ride. Then we had to walk a half
             mile to get to the chapel to play volleyball with the zone. It was so
             full in the trufi that a large native Bolivian women was sitting on
             Muñoz´s lap. We were laughing the whole time.<br>
             Well, that is what happened this week. This could possibly be my last
             week in El Paso, so I will try to make it the best one I can. Love you
             guys so much, thanks for everything, and I cant wait to call you guys
             again in 7 months.<br>
             Love,<br>
                Elder Bagley

                        <p>Today was pretty good, can't complain. We were obedient in the morning and did everything, the first time in too long. We had District and Zone meetings. I taught on the law of consecration and on constant improvement. It went well enough. Elder Galan had a great comment. He said that the way we feel when our investigators don't progress is how God feels when we don't progress. We promise to consecrate our lives to God when we enter the temple, so it is more than a compromise, it is a covenant. All of our district's numbers went down this week, so that is a problem I'm trying to fix. While at lunch, we got a call from Claudia saying she only had a few minutes to meet with us, so we ate quickly and went to talk to her in the plaza. We found her crying and found out she has a lot of problems going on. She thought that meant she couldn't see us anymore, but it actually means she needs it more. We had a good talk about things in general, and she said she needed to think about everything. Well, I read 3 Ne 17:3 and we have an appt for tomorrow. After that we visited the Flia Vasquez, where I basically just translated some english that was on a medicine box. We then ran into Franco in the street and went to talk to him about baptism. He basically just needs permission from his mom. We had to take a cat away that Franco brought home on Sunday, but Elsa doesn't want it, so we were supposed to take it away. Well, we had problems, so we took it back, but Muñoz just threw it in the house so we had to find it. I think it made Rosella mad. After that we went to teach Benito the word of wisdom. No problems there, we are still on a good path of getting him to baptism. It was Benita's birthday, so we ate some cake. It was a good enough day to start the week.</p>

                        <p>Recently I have had more energy in the morning, so I'm getting things done in the morning finally. We got up normally and left at 8:30 to go to meet with the Flia Nuñez. We ended up eating breakfast, lunch, and we taught a lesson. We talked to Rodrigo about the priesthood. We are planning on him receiving it on Sunday. He's ready for it. We also talked to Rosella about random stuff and then, as we were about to leave, Hna Elsa invited us to eat. I tried to nicely turn it down, but she got mad. I was too scared, so we just ate lunch there, and later with Benita. After lunch we taught Claudia in the Flia Chavez's house. She's still doing well, and I feel like she'll eventually be baptized. After that, we went home to study, and then went with Andrea Orellana to teach Gabriel. Turns out, he actually read. He just "happened" to open to 2 Ne 27, which was perfect for him. It was just the small hint of progress that will keep us working with him. We were gonna drop him. After, nothing really happened, just a regular day. Good enough day, no compaints.</p>

                        <p>Well, just a boring day. We got up and went to the Flia Chavez's house. We were going to go out with Hna Chavez to visit people, but for some reason we never left. We basically just ate breakfast. After that we went to a lesson with Benito. We talked about tithing and everything is still going well with him. Maribel told us she has been planning a special surprise for next saturday, his baptism. We are excited for him. We had lunch, then went home to study and plan. It was good enough I guess. We left at about 6:30 to go work. We first went to talk to Wilder Andia's family, but Indira told us to come back on Saturday. Then we went and talked to Hna Elsa. She told us that Indira and Wilder are back into problems. Uhhhh, they were doing so well, I'm not sure what happened. We are going to go on Saturday with Hno Saul Rojas and his wife, so that should help. We are worried about them. At night we went to the chapel. Rodrigo had his interview so he is good to go for the priesthood on Sunday. He and Cristian also stayed and played futsal. We talked to E' Cruz and he told us that the mission is awful right now. There aren't baptisms and missionaries are very disobedient. Elder Ochoa, a guy I knew in Sucre, got sent home with like 2 weeks left on his mission. We were the 3rd highest baptizing zone, with 5. The mission heeds a change. Right now I'm on an intercambio, so I'm in Colcapirhua with Elder Galan. I hopefully will learn a lot tomorrow, but we will just have to wait and see.</p>

                        <p>Intercambio. This is the first intercambio I've had where I went to another area since October. It was pretty good I guess. We woke up and studied and did all that stuff. The shower there was awful. There's not hot water, so I had to heat up water in a little water heater, use that water to fill up a little tub, then pour the water on myself. I felt like a little kid. Anyways, we had a few good experiences. First, we taught this lady named Rosemary. She knows the church is true, but isn't married so she isn't baptized. She really enjoys the lessons. After that we had lunch (Benita is the best pensionista in the world), then we had a lesson with this Cholita. She was really nice, but doesn't really pay attention during the lessons. After that, we taught Juan and Nancy. They're an old couple I interviewed about a month ago. They still haven't been able to get married though, but they are still in progress. They are awesome. They want to read the whole BoM, they understand everything, they know the temple and like buying things there. They are golden. Basically just waiting for the papers to get through the system so they can get married. After, we went to talk to Micaela, another person I interviewed. She is super shy, but we read a little and it was good. Her inactive older brother was home, but he was in his room "celebrating" his anniversary with his girlfriend... Then we talked to this crazy lady named Mimsi (she wrote SCOLA) in Galan's agenda and thought he was crazy for reading as Scola, instead of Mimsi. She talked really fast. Finally, we taught the 7 yr old girl named Abish, because her dad wants her prepared for baptism. The intercambio was good. Galan isn't a time waster and likes teaching. He needs to listen to the investigators a little more, but he's cool. I'm glad to be back in my bed though.</p>

                        <p>Whew, I like El Paso a lot more than Colcapirhua. Even though it has lot of cows, cholitas, dirt, it is big, and it is 25min from the chapel, it is home. Today was pretty uneventful, well up until the night. We studied and stuff, then we went to clal Muñoz's family to try to get things set up for tomorrow. He couldn't get a hold of anyone though. I just read this book called "Tal como un fuego". I read like 70 pages just waiting. It is a really interesting book that talks about missionaries. Then we ate lunch with some family I've never met before, but they have 2 sons on missions. The parents were also planning a mission when... they had a baby. That kinda ruined the plans. After lunch, we went around el Barrio, but we didn't really find anything. At 5 we were supposed to talk to the Flia Andia, but they weren't home. So, we went to talk to the Flia Nuñez, and the Andia girls were there too. They all seem pretty worried about the whole Wilder-Indira situation. We shared some videos and scriptures, and hopefully it helped. We then went to visit Aidee and Gabriel. They weren't there yet, but they were going to be there in 20 min, so we went to visit Benito. A dog tried to kill us on the way. We got there and found out BEnito wasn't going to be there for 20min. So we went back to Aidee and Gabriel and had a decent enough lesson. We gave it to them hard, but hopefully they understand they need to do something. After that, we taught Benito about Chastity, and then went to dinner, then home. Tomorrow should be a good day, and I get to call my family, woohoo.</p>

                        <p>Woohoo, it's Mother's day. Today Muñoz went to ward council, and I went with Israel Olmos to pick people up. We had a good number of people in the bus. We had Benito, Maribel, Aidee, Flia Riveros, Benita's family, Flia Nuñez, and Karla with her nieces. I realized that I was more focused on the people here than on my family at home. Church was good. With 4 investigators (Claudia showed up later), 2 converts, 1 reactivated, and 3 less actives, we were happy. The only interesting thing at church was an interesting talk with the bishop. We have gained his confidence, so that is good. He told us a lot about Rosella. She has a very interesting part and sometimes gets hit with depression. We are going to have to pay attention to that and help her. Also, neither the bishop nor Hna Gaby like Elder Apaza, and they want him to leave. After church we ate lunch with the bishop. For some reason, Elder Diazgranados and Elder Ruiz were there. After lunch, it was time for the call. Well, first I went with Muñoz cause he is still in the process of setting up his call, but can't get a hold of anyone. I called at Hno Jhonny Choque's house. It was good enough internet, it cut a few times, but it worked enough. I talked for about an hour again. It was great to talk to them again. They all are doing great, and I was able to give Griff advice for the mission. It wasn't as emotional this time, but I think it is because I'm more focused on the mission now. It was as good day, with the highlight obviously being the call.</p>

                        <p>P-DAY! Today was an interesting one. We got up and just relaxed. We left at 10 to go to the chapel, because we were going to have an activity there. We had seen blockeos and rumors of blockeos in the morning. However, we got to the plaza and we didn't see anything, so we got in the trufi and left. We got about 1km down the road and realized there was a blockeo on the road, so we took a back route and tried to get around the blockeo. However, we tried to pass it, but it had already caught up to where we were, so we had to take another back route. When that happened, there was an army of cholitas that stormed the trufi and tried to get it. There were like 5 that got in and one sat on top of Muñoz. With a full trufi, we took thte back route and finally got out after 40min. Then we had to walk another 20 to get to the chapel. Not the best way to start a day. However, we got to the chapel and it was fun. We had a BBQ and we played volleyball. A new guy, Elder Rosario, got here from the Dominican Republic, he is Elder Olson's comp. It was fun, and I like volleyball. The BBQ was good as well. After that we had internet which was good enough. We then went home... but there was a blockeo, so there weren't trufis. So we walked. 7km. It took forever, and we were so tired after. After that awful journey, we had Benito's interview. He's all ready. He's a stud. We are so excited for Saturday. Well, today was pretty tired, hoping I won't ever again have to walk 7km to get home.</p>
