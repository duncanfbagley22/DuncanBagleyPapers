            <h1>Week 3<small> (July 4, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>Sorry, couldn´t think of a clever title</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Familia,
   How is everyone? I really feel like I have been gone for like 6 months cause everyday is so jam packed. I had to bring my journal to the computer lab so that I could remember what happened. Trek sounds like it was a fun experience, spiritually fun too. It´s kinda amazing how pushing hardcarts in the dust can be a spiritual experience. Anyways, I am just gonna go through each day and say what happened, and then I will give a summary at the end. So...
Thursday after email- After email we got to go outside of the compound. It is definitely different. It was me, Christensen, Elder Toomer and 4 Hermanas. The temple was really small. We took up half of the session. It´s still the temple though, and it was really cool. We get to go again today. After we headed out to a church store where a picked up a peruvian tie which is pretty cool. We got to walk around a bit in Lima, which was cool. It is definitely not like any city I have been to before. Driving is crazy. They just do whatever they want. We also got to go to Tottus, which is like a Peruvian wal mart. It has everything, even 3 liter bottles of coke. That night we got to hear from an Area seventy Elder Carlos Solis. He was pretty cool and talked about how important having the Spirit is.
Friday- We got to hear from Elder D Todd Christofferson. It was crazy having an apostle speak to 70 or so missionaries. He speaks fluent spanish, so we had one of the Latino elders, who is from Phily, translate. Memorable for him. What are the chances i would be in the mtc when peru got its 100th stake. It had 50 in 2006, think about that. We got to shake his hand after and he said my name and good luck. It was awesome, he has this great spirit about him which is what we should all strive for.
Saturday- We went ¨tracting¨ today. It was actually just pretending to contact members pretending to be investigators. It was difficult. They spoke fast and asked hard questions. I got put with one of the older elders, and I ended up leading a lot of the conversations cause I have more experience with spanish. It got easier as we went along. I also am tired like everyday, but such is life, i am getting more used to the schedule now.
Sunday- Sunday was the first day the sun came out in about a week. Get it, sun   day. chiste, that means joke in spanish. The hardest part of the day was having to lead a 50 minute discussion on the plan of salvation with my district, while the branch president watched. It went really well though. Not that I was trying to impress him, but I was trying to impress him. Also, me and Elder Christensen had comp inventory, which is where you just discuss the companionship and now we are like on the same page on everything, like we say the same things at the same time and its just weird. We are a solid companionship.
Monday- monday night was so sad. We had to say bye to the Latino elders. We sat around taking some pictures for a while and then we sang God be with you till we meet again in mixed english and spanish. It was completely off key, but it was awesome. they tried singing in english and it was just cool. Honestly, I love the Latinos like brothers. 3 of them are gonna write me and stuff. they are awesome.
Tuesday- honestly, I cant remember what happened tuesday. I designated Tuesday as the worst day of the week.
Wednesday- We met our new elders in our room. Ramos from Bogota Columbia, and Valencia from Huancayo peru. They are cool, but it will be hard for them to top cama and honores.Elder Price also decided to talk with a hick accent now, so the Latinos think he is weird, which he is. I have to end this email soon and start again cause it might log me off. Lo siento. I will talk more about the week after.

                <br><br>
                Today- got a haircut, I dont look too weird, so that is good. The new
elders came in this morning. One of them is Cooper Harris that I
played soccer with, so now I know someone here. Right now I am in the
comp lab with 7 americans and like 25 latinos, so it is crowded.

Ok, now I am just gonna free write. I miss the Latinos so much. Elder
Tuesta was this little chubby latino that has the best laugh ever. He
always pretended to shoot me whenever he saw me. He would always say
¨Elder Blakgñasj, he couldnt really say Bagley, zhu is my my friend¨.
Also, something I forgot, which is weird, is guess who I saw when I
got out of the shower yesterday. None other than THE Elder Endicott.
He and his companion were staying the night and then they were flying
out the Trujillo. It was the weirdest thing to walk up to him shaving
in my bathroom. We ate breakfast together and we took a picture with
his camera, so I will get it eventually. I am pretty happy I got my
visa though, cause he has been all over the place. I am glad I got to
see him. It also made me confident that the CCM was the place for me.
I like having 100 missionaries, instead of thousands. Also, we get
surrounded by spanish every day, so understanding is easier. We
definitely go where we are supposed to go. I like being a veteran here
and telling all the new guys what it is like. Also, i dont know if i
mentioned how awesome my district is. We have 2 cochabamba elders, and
8 chiclayo hermanas. They are great. Apparently I am a different
person here than at home. No one believes that I was a quiet guy cause
I talk so much here. It is like day and night. I love talking with my
teachers in spanish too. I say things that are funny and they just
look at me like que en el mundo Bagley. Its funny. I am no longer a
man of few words, at least not in Peru. Some of my district is falling
behind in spanish, so naturally I had to teach an hour long spanish
class yesterday. Weird stuff. We have a toy pig in our class named
Brian, and its funny how much fun I have with him. I still have 20
minutes left to type, so im trying to think. Here are some of the good
spiritual moments. The last night with cama and honores, we knelt and
said 2 prayers, one in english one in spanish. The spirit was
definitely there. Another thing, I can pray teach and bare my
testimony in spanish now. I have come pretty far. Another great moment
was we were singing Nearer my God to Thee in class one day, in spanish
of course. After the second verse I decided to drop the bass and sing
a part, and for some reason it just felt so great. The music struck a
chord, chiste, and I felt the spirit strong. It was awesome. I guess i
will wrap up now. I´m healthy and happy, everything is going well.
Hope to hear from anyone.. really our mailbox is empty and it is
depressing. Anyways, church is true. I know it, God knows it, and I
cant deny it. Good luck at moon lake and im jealous that you get to
see matt. If you want some good scriptures, just go read all of them.
They are great if you really look into them. Love you all</small>

                        <p>(also contains entry from July 1)<br><br> Today was good/bad. By today I mean monday and tuesday. Good cause I’ve been getting better at teaching and just playing it by the Spirit. We now have 2 investigators, so 2 to prepare for. The new one is Hermano Bernuy as a Catholic Professor. We did solid. Me and Elder Christiansen, pretty sure I spelled that wrong #FAIL, are getting along pretty well. Our other investigator now has gotten a BoM answer which is awesome. Sad part is that the Latinos are gone. Last night we just took a bunch of pictures and got info and stuff. I can’t believe I knew them for 12 days and they became some of my best friends. Me, Elder Price, and others were talking about how much it sucks that they’re gone now and it’s the worst. We had a goodbye song, “God be with you till we meet again”. It was cool to see Latinos and North Americans coming together to sing in English and spanish. It was awesome. I’m gonna miss those Elders so much.<br></p>

                        <p>Life is different. We have 2 new elders in our room. They are Elder Valencia from Huancayo, Peru and Elder Ramos from Bogotá, Columbia. They seem good so far, but they have a long way to go before thy are like Honores and Cama. Not having them here makes me miss them even more. Oh well, things will improve. Tomorrow is P-day and the 4th of July, go America. One cool thing we did today was try to help some of the Hermanas that are slower at spanish. I was “teaching” the class. I kinda like this whole being in charge thing. I’m a completely different person here than at home. Here I’m outgoing and I talk to everyone. No one believes me when I say I’m really a shy guy. Oh well, está bien. Glad tomorrow is P-day, I need a haircut. Best part of the day is Elder Price now has a hick accent for fun, so the Latinos think he is weird.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>Happy B-day, Amurica! Weird to have the 4th outside the USA. For lunch they decorated the cafeteria red white and blue. It was fun, I felt patriotic. It was P-day today. Hearing from the family was great. I heard my brother bore his testimony at trek. He has had a hard time recently, but he really wants faith and I’m proud of him. We got to go to the temple too and we went through the vail in spanish, but I ended up having to correct the worked a bit. Made me realize I do know things. We got to hang around Lima a bit, and I found out I can’t really fit in a bus, theyre about 5’3 tall… During our lesson with Jorge, I just unleashed spanish. It felt good. Our relationship with our roommates has gotten better too. I forgot to mention that Elder Jeremy Endicott came and stayed overnight once. It was cool to see him. CCM is better than MTC though. I’m starting to really love it here, which is good. I’m fully adjusted.<br><br><br><br>

                        <p>I’m not 100% sure what happened today. I keep blending days together and I’m never sure what happens what day. What I do know is that today was decent enough. Before lunch I was about to die cause I was so tired. We played volleyball for about the 10th day in a row. We have a good group we play with and I’m getting pretty good. There was one bad thing today. There is some unChristlike feelings between Hermanas Grant and Larsen in our district. Larsen is a really picky and opinionated person. Grant just tries to get along, but she is quiet and doesn’t really speak her feelings so Larsen is really mean to her. It made me grateful for how great me and Elder Christensen get along. We are different, but we’re open to new ways of doing things. I hope everything gets better between the Hermanas, cause I don’t want an unhappy district. Other than that all is well. We san the 1st Noel in class, not sure why. Oh well, life as an intermediate is going well. <br>

                        <p>Uhhhh… it’s the day before fast Sunday. It is hour 10 without food, and for some reason I’m thinking about it more. Oh well, está bien. The zone leader Elder Hughes says “está bien” about every 10 seconds. Today was decent though. I’ve been reading about the history and persecution of the church. I knew it was bad, but not as bad as it really was. It makes me grateful for their sacrifice. If I ever think life is hard, I can just remember them. We played soccer for once, I was decent, not as good as before though. The Latinos are starting to warm up to us, which is good. Tomorrow is Elder Ramos’s bday. It’s weird that tomorrow is my 3rd Sunday. It seems fast and slow at the same time. Oh well, está bien.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>Crap, I think I’m sick. It seems like everybody is getting sick. I’ve got a cold or something. Oh well, está bien. Today was long. 1 ½ hours of DL meetings, church meetings for 3 hrs, and like 3 hrs of personal study. Plus, no breakfast. I felt bad cause I fell asleep during an apostle video. I try so hard not to, but it is hard. On the bright side, I finished another book. 2 more than I usually would. Next up is Jesus the Christ, 800 pages of long sentences and big words. I don’t know as much about the life of Christ as I would want though, so it will be good. The Latinos are starting to warm up to us, so that is good. Hopefully they learn our names too. Overall, it was just a normal Sunday. However, I did feel the Spirit fairly strong when Elder Harris (Cooper Harris) bore his testimony. I knew him at BYU and we were on the same soccer team for a year. Pretty cool stuff. Todos está bien, pero estoy enfermo.<br></p>

                        <p>I never know how to start my journal entries. It’s not like anyone is gonna read this anyways. Anyways, today was aight. The most impactful thing was teaching an “investigator”. It was just another teacher, but he’s like studying to be a brain surgeon, so he is a smart guy. He made us work for everything and taught us a lot. I really enjoyed it though. We are going out contacting saturday, so that’ll be fun. Today was also “family night” cause I told everyone to bring pictures of their family to class. It made me really miss my family. They’re the best ever. Also, we are starting to get along with the Latinos better. Ours are still quiet, but they’re nice and the others in the other rooms are way funny. They are just as nice as Honores, Cama and those guys. We played volleyball against Elder Toomer and Elder Bowyer’s district today. We won obviously. Worst part of the day was being sick still. Oh well, life is good.<br><br>
