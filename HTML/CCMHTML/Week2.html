            <h3>Where is Elder Bagley?</h3>
            <p><small>¡Hola Mi Familia, y otras personas que quieren leer esta carta!
   I hope trek is going well. First thing, my bags finally got here on Friday afternoon. I think it was just what I wanted, to have my bags lost in a foreign country, it´s awesome. They got here though, so everything is fine now. Thanks so much for the birthday stuff. The cards especially made my day. The first few days in the CCM are the longest days ever. I felt like they each took about 8 years. It was awfully long, but everything is good now. The days are still long, but you look back on them and it feels like it flew by. I´m trying to think of what the important things to tell you are, since I just assume everything here is normal, but I realize you don´t know anything about it. My daily schedule is to wake up at 6:30, sit in bed for a minute and contemplate why I am getting up so early. Shower and all that fun stuff, then head to breakfast. Our classes and rooms are all in one building and the food and administration and auditorium are in another building. We call the CCM a compound cause we are in the same places all day. We have a morning set of classes with 2 teachers and that´s where we learn most the spanish. Our teachers are Hermanos Bernuy and Ruiz, and Brian I guess. Brian is a toy pig that is the class mascot. We have class with our district only. Oh yeah, that´s important I guess. I´m district leader. It isn´t really a hard job, and since I am one of 2 elders in my district, it´s not like I am that special, but I enjoy leading. Our district is me and Elder Christensen and 8 Hermanas. There are soooooooooo many Hermanas here. There are about 20 North American Elders and like 70 Hermanas. It is rediculous. After class we have lunch. I have eaten rice for every single lunch and dinner except for one. It´s rice rice rice all day. After lunch we have an hour of personal study and an hour of language study. Something I gotta get used to is my companion. He´s a super hard worker and a nice guy which is great. Problem is he would rather study than just about anything. He´s also pretty hard on himself. When it comes to teaching and stuff though, he´s the best companion I could ask for. He just needs to relax sometimes, which was said in a talk by someone I can´t remember. He´s great though, we´re different, but we are a dynamite teaching team. After study we have gym. Gym is so fun. Theres volleyball basketball soccer fusbol ping pong and stuff. I have to end this email right now and start it back up cause we get an hour for email, but the computer only allows a half hour, so I´ll write more in a bit, sending to be safe though.<br><br>

                Ok, we´re good. Ok, so we played volleyball the other day, or 3 days and it was so fun. We had like 11 of us. I´m decent at volleyball so it was good. We played with this little Elder from Peru named Elder Cayetano. He is 23, but he can´t be more than 4 foot 10. He´s the funniest guy ever though. Every time the ball came to him he´d hit it to me and just yell "Elder Bagley" and we would go back and forth. Anytime I would do anything bad he´d just look at everyone and say, "where is Elder Bagley, which is one of the few english phrases he knows. This brings me to the next thing, Peruvian people are the best. They love everyone so much. We get to be in a room with 2 Elders from Peru. They are Elderes Honores and Cama. They are the ones in the picture if it comes through. On my birthday, I woke up and Elder Honores sang me Happy Birthday in English and wrote me a note. It was awesome. Every night I just get back to the room and talk with them about family or whatever. Cama has been a member for about a year and a half. He wants to go to BYU, but says it is too expensive. Honores is just super chill. He says he played soccer professionally in peru, but I´m not sure if I believe him, he was pretty good when we played though. It´s amazing that although we dont speak the same language, we can communicate. They help my spanish a lot. We pray with them every night and they give us hugs. Sucks they leave on Tuesday. Nighttime we have class with 2 other teachers and one is our progressive investigator named Jorge. We just committed him to baptism, cause we´re awesome, or probably through the spirit. We teach our whole lessons in spanish and everything we get taught is in spanish. I definitely haved learned more this week than in the 3 years at school. Every night we get fruit and the best is a grenadia. Look it up, it looks like alien brains. The best thing here is definitely the church side though. We hear so many great spiritual things. We get to go to the temple every p day, so we are leaving in 20 minutes. Itll be our first chance to actually see anything. The 3 best things I have learned spiritually have been this. 1) Desire, Diligence, Faith, that´s all it really takes to succeed at anything. 2) I was called to succeed at my mission, not fail. 3) Any member who reads this, go out and get some missionary work done. Members are the best. Elder Christofferson is coming here this week. Sorry if I didnt answer your questions all the way, this is my first experience with the emailing. Let me know how life is and who the Jazz draft (only I would care). Church is true, and I know it and if you don´t go find out.<br><br>
Dad- good look on trek trail boss, love you so much<br>
Mom- thanks for preparing me so much for my mission, I notice little things you did to help every day.<br>
Rachel- Thanks for the letter, it helps that you told me all the good things<br>
Griff- Good luck on trek, Renfros would be the best parents for trek
<br><br>
I´m so scatterbrained right now. Sorry about that. If anyone wants to write me, dear elder works in the CCM, and a bonus is they call my name on the intercom if I get a letter, so I would be a celebrity.
                <br>
Love, <br><br>Elder Bagley</small>

                        <p>Today went by pretty fast I guess. Between like 9 and 12 the day is slow, but the rest goes by fast. We taught our investigator Jorge about Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon. He said he’d read and pray and if he got an answer he’d be baptized. That’s exactly how we wanted it to end, the middle was different, but the ending is what’s important. I talked a lot more with the Latinos and that is really the best part of every day. Our Peruvian teachers told us Bolivians are nicer than Peruvians, and if that is somehow possible, Bolivia will be great. I officially have 5 weeks until I leave for there, so I’m excited. One important lesson I learned today was from a talk from Elder Bednar. He said we need to stop looking for the spirit in the moment, but realize it afterwards. I think that means to stop trying to push for the spirit, but just let it happen. If you are doing what’s right, it will come.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>Today was good. Nothing real important happened, cause the schedule was exactly the same as yesterday. We taught Jorge about baptism, he committed for Saturday if he finds out it is true. That’s what we’re shooting for. Found out we don’t get to go proseliting (can’t spell) on Saturday, which is sad, but it is because Elder Christofferson is coming and I think we get to hear him speak. That’d be sweet! Anyways, everything is good, we are now always spending gym time with Elder Bowyer from Gilbert Arizona and Elder Toomer from Morgan Utah. They’re funny guys. Toomer is going to Cochabamba. Tomorrow is P-day, which is much needed. I’m starting to get tired of the same thing every day, Elder Honores says he is a former pro soccer player from Peru, not sure if I believe him… But that’d be sweet.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>Today was P-day, and I loved it. We got to relax, I took a nap, we got to write our families, we got to go to the temple… it was great. Best part was finally getting out on the street instead of being locked in class all day. Lima is different, but once you get used to it, it’s awesome. People are either really nice or scared of us. The temple was great, but the pants only went to my calves, like halfway. The temple is also really small, compared to the likes of Salt Lake. It was still awesome. We also went to the uncertified temple store, just a room in someone’s house, but I got a sweet Lima temple tie. We got to walk around Lima and go to Tottu’s, a Peruvian Wal-mart. We also got a fireside from an area seventy (Elder Carlos Solis). He was great. Taught a lot of good stuff about the spirit and such. Overall, solid day.

Funniest part: I joke with this big guy Elder Tuesta that he’s in the mafia, and he says Elder Price is the mafia. I was in the bathroom talking to Price about how Tuesta is gonna turn him in, and all of the sudden Tusta jumped out of the shower and pretended to shoot us. It was so funny, I spit my toothpaste out. Good stuff.

                        <p>Well today was special. We got to hear from Elder D. Todd Christofferson. It was the first time an apostle has been to Peru (MTC) and he just so happened to come when I was in the CCM, what’re the chances… He spoke of the importance of using the BoM to teach and we got to shake his hand after. You can tell he is a man of God. His relationship with the spirit is what we should strive for. First large meeting where I wasn’t tired at all. We taught our Progressive Investigator about commandments. We had to Explain the Word of Wisdom and challenge him to not drink coffee. It’s similar to a situation we could see in the field. Tonight Elder Tuesta jumped out from behind a corner and started pretending to shoot me. He has such a funny laugh. I’m gonna miss these Latinos. The relationship I’ve built in 1 ½ weeks is better than any you could get with a North American in 1 year. Latinos are special people. <br>

                        <p>Today was interesting. We got to go “tracting” with some members of the church acting as investigators. It was way harder than I thought. They spoke really fast. I felt pretty good about my teaching though. At times it was difficult, but when I got my thoughts together, I did pretty well. As well or better than my senior companion. I’ve been getting comments about how good my spanish is coming along, which makes me feel good. The only thing I haven’t been able to fix is the fact that I fall asleep in class once a day. I go to be on time, so I don’t know why I’m tired… oh well, church is true.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>Sunday #2. The sun finally came out… on a “sun” day… chiste. It was pretty good. The older missionary group sang a goodbye song and I felt the spirit for sure. I had a hard time staying awake in Priesthood. In Sunday School I had to lead the discussion/lesson with the Branch Pres. in the room. It was scary, but I think it went well. Me and elder Christensen had a good comp. Inventory too, so we’re on the same page now. Today is just sad though, I have to say bye to the Latinos tomorrow, I’m gonna miss them so much. They’re already my really good friends after 12 days. Latinos are awesome!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>(also contains entry from July 2)<br><br> Today was good/bad. By today I mean monday and tuesday. Good cause I’ve been getting better at teaching and just playing it by the Spirit. We now have 2 investigators, so 2 to prepare for. The new one is Hermano Bernuy as a Catholic Professor. We did solid. Me and Elder Christiansen, pretty sure I spelled that wrong #FAIL, are getting along pretty well. Our other investigator now has gotten a BoM answer which is awesome. Sad part is that the Latinos are gone. Last night we just took a bunch of pictures and got info and stuff. I can’t believe I knew them for 12 days and they became some of my best friends. Me, Elder Price, and others were talking about how much it sucks that they’re gone now and it’s the worst. We had a goodbye song, “God be with you till we meet again”. It was cool to see Latinos and North Americans coming together to sing in English and spanish. It was awesome. I’m gonna miss those Elders so much.
