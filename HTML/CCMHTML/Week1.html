            <h1>Week 1 <small>(June 20, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>First Day woohoo</h3>
            <p><small>¡Hola Familia!
      Hey folks, Duntin here. I didnt send the email to mom cause i got confused on stuff and i didnt want it to not send at all. Next week ill try to figure it out. Well, I made it. The flight was really long. I slept in like 5 different positions for most of it, and I just stared at the flight map for the rest of the time. When I got off the plane, the most wonderful thing happened. Me and 2 other girls found out that American Airlines left our bags in LAX cause they forgot to transfer them. I have to wait till Saturday to get my bags, so good thing mom planned to have me put extra clothes in. The MTC will give me other stuff like a razor and garments until my bags come. Of course it would be me that got my bags left, but at least I know where they are. We got into the MTC at 3 30ish, but they let us sleep in until 9. We had little natives trying to wake us up at 6 30 and we were like ´´no no, we get till 9´´ and they just kept shaking our hands and smiling. They seem nice, we haven t really met them though. If you can t tell, im obviously on a spanish keyboard, and i dont know where things like an apostrophe are so just try to understand. I like it here. I kinda wanna be done with all the paper work and logistical stuff, but the layout is nice. Elder Christensen is my companion, he reminds me a little of Jeremy Endicott, just ready to do everything, but he is gonna be a great companion. He played basketball and football in high school and is just an all around cool guy. We have made pretty good friends with 3 other elders. One is Elder Underwood and he is from Tuscon, just a normal easy going guy. He waited for me when I was dealing with the baggage situation. Another is Elder Praag, he just graduated from Alta 2 weeks ago and he is now in the field. He said he has 25 pounds of nutella in his suitcase, Im not sure if I believe him, but he definitely has a lot. The last one is Elder Price, he also went to Alta. He played basketball at Dixie St last year and he is 6 foot 6. He is really funny and just goofs around. They are all good guys though. They all are going to Peru missions. The food has been interesting so far. We had a piece of bread and some corn flake like material for breakfast. We also got pineapple juice, but it is the real stuff, like from a juicer. Peru is definitely different than anywhere I have been before. The bus we rode on felt like it would break at any minute. All the houses look like little shacks. There is also like a permanent haze in the sky, kinda like Seattle. This keyboard is in an uncomfortable position for someone my height. It is a little bit daunting having people speak spanish to us, but I am sure it will get easier. Today is pretty relaxed, but tomorrow the real stuff starts. I am excited to get out and have gym time, maybe try to convince the little natives that we play in the nba. I am also excited to get going on all the church stuff. Thats really why I am here. I already can feel the comfort of the Spirit in certain times, as I have gotten nervous still. Sorry that I am all over the place in my ideas. I didnt really plan what to say, so i am just saying what comes to mind. There are 12 elders here, and about a million sisters. Its crazy. It just shows how the age change really changed things. I guess i really do get a birthday present, it will be my bags. Anyways, p day is on thursday, so youll have to wait until then. I would write more, but we have a timer on emails, so i gotta go quick. I love you guys so much. I miss you like crazy, but this is where the Lord wants me. Rachel said I should write little personal notes, so ill do that.
                <br><br>

Gurf- Thanks for being the best brother ever. Like i tried to choke out at the airport, make sure you arent there when i get back, meaning you do everything you can to get on a mission. Love ya buddy, let me know when your double rainbow dragon hatches<br>
Rachel- I love you so much. You were a great example growing up<br>
Dad- thanks for the email, I was surprised to already have one from you. You were the best priesthood example growing up and i love you<br>
Mom- thanks for the note, it really comforted me when I was getting nervous and anxious. You did so much for me growing up and I really appreciate it.
 <br><br>
I love you guys so much. Church is true, no doubt about it. I gotta go, timer is almost out. Let me know how things are going and good luck on trek, we will both be on spiritual highs.
                <br>
Love,
     <br><br>           Your favorite Elder, Elder Bagley</small></p>

                        <p>Today I began my mission. I got on a plane at 7:00am from Salt Lake to Los Angeles. Leaving my family was really hard. I love them and I’ll miss them like crazy, but I know this is what I am supposed to be doing. I am currently on a plane from Los Angeles to Lima, Peru. Honestly, I’m scared to death. I’m going by myself to a foreign country, speaking a language I don’t know very well. I’m scared to even write on the customs forms. Hopefully, the language will come, but for right now, I’m pretty darn scared.</p>

                        <p>Well I made it through the first day. It was kinda long, but there were some good parts. My bags got lost, so I don’t get them until the 22nd, happy birthday to me… I enjoy the elders and sisters here, they are all really cool. We have 2 latinos in our room, and their english is as good as my spanish, so not great. Our communication will get better though. It doesn’t matter that we can’t communicate, cause the gospel is true in any language. Another thing, I got made district leader today, so that’s kinda cool. Anyways, church is true, whether it’s in Peru or Utah, and that’s a fact.</p>

                        <p>Today was the first full day of the MTC. It was really up and down. At times I thought it was really hard, other time were really fun. The things that kept me going were speaking with the Latinos, cause that improves things for some reason, and a phrase I learned in clase. Desire, diligence, faith. Those are steps it takes to accomplish things. We learned to pray in spanish. It’s basic, but it is cool. Also, my bags arrived! Woohoo! I told the Latinos, “Mis equipajes están aquí, está como Navidad” I hope that’s correct… Anyways, if I can just keep the good half of the day always, the MTC will be great.</p>

                        <p>¡Es mi cumpleaños! Woohoo! It was a good birthday, a lot different than all the others. Definitely, the best part of my birthday was my Latino roommate. (I spell bad) He sang Happy Birthday to me in english, and gave me a note that says Happy Birthday with a smiley face. It is one of the best presents I’ve ever gotten. Simple, but great. Their english is worse than our spanish, so he probably put a lot of effort in. True charity; he loves me and I’ve known him for 3 days. I got to play soccer/fútbol with the Latinos also. It was fun, I still am pretty good. My spanish is coming along well. It’s not perfect, but the CCM is a great place to learn. Today still had its ups and downs, but I think there were more ups, so that’s good. They say make it to Sunday and everything gets better, so I’ve made it, and I hope it gets even better. </p>

                        <p>Today was the first Sunday. Crazy to think that I’ve already been here 5 days. The days definitely feel like weeks, but the weeks feel like days. Today was definitely my favorite day so far. No class, just learning. I was falling asleep a lot, but I liked everything still. We watched the Joseph Smith movie, and I like that every time. There was a conference broadcast around the world. They told members to work harder as missionaries. This should make the full-time work easier. The quote I heard today that helped was by Richard G. Scott. He said something like “You were called (as a missionary) to succeed, not fail!” It gave me a pick me up. Also, we had a good time talking to Elder Cama and Elder Honores about family and school. If everyday keeps getting better, I’m going to love it here.</p>

                        <p>Not sure how I felt about today. At times I just wanted to bang my head on the wall; other times, it was awesome. The morning consisted of nothing special. Just more spanish and stuff. Not sure if I mentioned it, but in our morning class we have a class mascot. A class pig, a little toy, named Brian, which is the name of one of the other teachers. Our morning teachers are Hermano Franco Bernuy y (spanish) Hermano Ricardo Ruiz. They’re funny guys. On the board I wrote, “Tenemos fe en Brian el chancho, él es un chancho verdadero”. They liked that a lot. Also, we played volleyball with some American Elders, 3 Hermanas in our district, and 2 little Latinos. Elder Cayetano, a little guy that is shorter than 5 feet tall, kept saying “Where is Elder Bagley”, when I’d do bad. It was CCM trash talk. Me and Elder Christensen taught our fake investigator his first lesson today, on the plan of salvation. Our spanish is mediocre, but the lesson went pretty well. We have to teach again tomorrow. I really hope that one of the days, I’ll enjoy the entire day, not just parts.</p>
