            <h1>Week 4 <small>(July 11, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>¿Quién es? Soy yo</h3>
            <p><small>Hola otra vez,
        It honestly feels like I was writing my other email about 2 days ago.
Sorry that it messed up, darn latino computers. Anyways, this week has
flown by. I don´t really know where the time went. I will try to
remember what happened this week. We went to the temple today at 7:30.
Pretty darn early, but it was worth it. We went through all in
spanish, and by we I mean me and Elder Christiansen. It was harder and
easier than I expected, if that makes any sense. It made me realize
that my spanish is pretty solidish. Mom... I got sick. Not like dengue
fever or malaria, just a cold, and I am 90% better now. That was the
worst part of the week. If you are wondering, the latinos are getting
better. The ones in our room are pretty quiet, but they´re nice guys.
The ones in the other rooms on our floor are super funny though. That
is where I got the name of my email. It is the first words to a
spanish song. It reminds me of baby its cold outside, that kinda song.
So naturally, me and Elder Price decided to learn the words and sing
it in class. His teacher and our teacher are engaged, so our classes
interact a lot. It goes like this... Quien es. Soy yo. Que vienes a
buscar. A ti. Ya es tarde. Lo se. Then some other line I cant
remember. Then Por eso vete olvidea mi nombre mi cara mi casa, y pega
mi vuelta (spin move dance). It was really funny. Im pretty sure the
latino teacher think I am just the weirdest kid, but they like me and
we get along. It also helps that I can kinda speak spanish too. Which
reminds me, I just had 2 conversations in spanish for a good length of
time in the temple and the temple store with 2 latinos. My spanish is
about a C- right now I would say. It gets better everyday though.
Worst thing of the week was definitely in volleyball. We have a solid
group that plays everyday, and every is decent enough. I went up to
spike it and out of no where comes this little 5 foot tall girl on the
other team and she gets up and blocks my spike. My dignity was
depleted. Worst moment ever. Oh well. Esta bien. As always, I am gonna
have to send the first half of the email and then I will start back up
again. I am trying to think of what more to say. I probably will get
released this week. I love being DL though. It is so much fun and my
district is great. I am gonna send this now. Hasta luego</small></p>

                        <p>Tuesday... I always hate tuesdays. I can't think of anything good about tuesdays. I'm pretty sure 9/11/2001 was a tuesday. I bet every world war started on tuesday... Anyways, today was not too bad. We didn't have to teach, we played a lot of volleyball. I tried to learn spanish, and I got a churro. Pretty solid. I've been reading Jesus the Christ, which is really hard. It made my brain hurt from thinking too deep. We also had a good talk in class about the Book of mormon. I got to talk to Eler Christensen about my favorite scripture, Helamn 5:12. It's kinda well known, but I still like it. I felt the Spirit in class. I like when I can recognize the Spirit. That is something I want to get better at. The Latinos are starting to warm up. If strangers are a 0 and Cama and Honores are a 10, they're sitting at a 6, so it's getting better. Americans are generally a 3 anyways.</p>

                        <p>Today was pretty good. It went by pretty fast. We learned a lot of spanish and taught 2 lessons. I got my volleyball spike blocked by a 5' tall girl, and that made me a bit sad. I also made the mistake of saying "Tendrá fuerza en sus huevos si guardar la Palabra de Sabiduría". Huesos means bones, huevos (what I said) means eggs. Hermano Machuca laughed at me. Our first lesson was solid as we talked just about Christ. It was good and spiritual. Me and Elder Price learned a spanish song that says: "Quién es? Soy yo, Que vienes a buscar, a ti, ya es tarde, lo sé, and stuff like that. It's a cheesy love song, and the teachers thought it was funny. These are the things I ahve to do to keep myself going in the CCM. Tomorrow is p-day!

                        <p>P-day #3. Today was solid. We had the early temple time at 7:30, so that was early. I had to do everything in spanish too, but that wasn't too bad. In the temple we had a good conversation with a Ecuadorian guy who was really nice. Also in the temple store I talked to this guy for a while. He did charcoal drawings for the store. Overall, Latinos are nice. I got a solid 45 min nap too. I got to write my family too, and my dad happened to be online at the same time so we kinda chatted a bit. We got to hear an Area 70 speak too. He spoke on how important your companion is and to just follow the spirit's promptings, don't question it. It was Angel Alicon I think his name was. I found out that I get released Sunday as DL. Kinda bummed, even though I knew I was going to be released. Oh well, Christensen will be great. 1 more day till proselitizing, scary...</p>

                        <p>¡Feliz Cumpleaños Mama! I miss my family. Weird that I ahve been gone for about 23 or so days. I'm halfway done with the CCM, then it's the real stuff. Tomorrow is a taste of the real stuff. We are going out to try to contact. My companion will be Elder Ramos. He's great, so we should be fine. Today reminded me that I'm actually decent at soccer, even against Latinos. I was ballin hard today. I nutmegged Hermana Hill for redemption for blocking my spike. I think the Latinos thought I was good. It was fun. I really am excited to get out and teaching. That's what I'm here to do anyways. This would've been so fun with Cama and Honores, but stuff happens for a reason. I was writing a spanish talk today. Not half bad. Life is so different now. I still think about home every now and then, but I'm doing good. I'd say I'm about 70% missionary mode, and hoping to get better. Overall, todo está bien.</p>

                        <p>First off, we had a small earthquake on Friday. My first one ever. It was kinda fun. It couldn't even knock stuff off my desk, so it was tiny. Some Hermanas were scared, but me and Elder Christensen just laughed. Anyways, today we went out. Like out out. To Santa Anita. Boy was it different. I went with Elder Ramos. We did pretty well. Talked to about 12-15 people, got 8 contacts, taught 4 lessons, gave out a bunch of pamphlets and placed on BoM. It is a completely different experience. Really tiring, but rewarding. We were out for about 4 hours. We talked ot some families, some old dudes, and had one guy call us liars. We had one guy explain a concept to another right after we taught him. It would be great if even one progresses. I realized my spanish understanding isn't as great as I though, but I speak well enough what I know. I just need time. The people were great. Most would listen, even if they weren't intersted. Different than the USA. I feel weird. In the moment I felt tired and lazy, but I wanna go do it again. It'll be awesome when I can see progression. Overall, a good experience in the real life of a missionary.</p>

                        <p>Sunday #4. It feels like I've been here forever, and like I just got here. Time flies and goes slow. Right now we are asking the roomies why they are on missions in Spanish. Good stuff. These Latinos are totally different from the others, but I still like them. Sunday was a normal sunday I said a SACRAMENT prayer in Spanish. I also got released as DL, which kinda bummed me out, even though I knew it was coming. I st need to sit back and let my companion take over now. We got to hear a devotional from Elder Holland. It was classic Holland, He just layed out how important it is to be a missionary and how much we are expected to do. We have to honor the calling and not let anyone down. It made me more focused on helping other people and not myself primarily. It is God's time, not mine, and I need to honor that. I'd say I'm 75% missionary now.
                            <br><br>Side note: Hma. Fuller, this Hermana in my district, killed a fly with my notebook today... tomorrow I need payback.</p>

                        <p>Final night #2. These latinos weren't a close to us as the others, but they were Still good. I'll miss them, and it will be hard to change Latinos again. I got a picture with the litle Latinos where I have to bend down, kinda funny. Elder Ramos will always be my first ever actual tracting companion so I'll remember him. Today was solid all around. Not too bad, not amazing. In the morning we taught Marco. One awesome moment was when we were talking about prayer and I brought up Enos and his journey and Elder Christensen pointed out vs. 4 that says "and my soul hingered" which was awesome. Elder Christensen also hit me with a stick which hurt. I got semi blocked Hma. Hill again... whatever. On the board in class I wrote "Yo fui el lider que el distrito merecía/mercería, pero no que necesitaba," which translates to "I was the leader the district deserved, but not the one it needed similar to the Dark Knight. Overall, life is good, weird I'm going to oldest group in the CCM tomorrow.
