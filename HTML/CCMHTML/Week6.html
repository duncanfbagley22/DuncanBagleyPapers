            <h1>Week 6 <small>July 25, 2013</small></h1>
            <h3>What the frost</h3>
            <p><small>Como estan mis personas favoritas en todo el mundo? This is my last
time writing a letter from Peru. I´m out in 5 days. Loco. I know that
I can call, but it´ll be somewhere between tuesday morning and
wednesday night. Be ready for literally anytime. I will do my best to
figure it out to what´s best for you. Anywho, crazy busy/boring week.
A lot happened in the first 3 days, and then nothing recently. We went
to the temple for the last time this morning. Kinda sad. We went to
the temple store and guess who just so happens to be there. Rachel
Langston, I think. Maybe her little sister, but pretty sure Rachel.
She was with this school building group. We met the leader last week
cause he is good friends with one of the hermanas. Well it was weird
to see Rachel. I havent heard Duncan in a long time. Sneekily, I
bought Griff a Cochabamba temple tie. Rachel got a picture for proof.
Mom, you owe her 14 soles. Weird to see someone from home here. Other
interesting things that have happened. Literally 30 minutes after I
finished my email, Elder Christensen (EC) messed up his ankle. We were
playing soccer and he just rolled it, but it swelled up like crazy. He
has been in a boot and crutches since. He has a grade 2 ankle sprain
and wont be 100% for 4-6 weeks. Bummer, but he is a champ. Im pretty
sure the scripture Isaiah 7 11 explains it. Anyways, great experience
that night. He wanted a blessing, so I got the 14 elders in our group
together and we gave him one in the classroom. Elder Price annointed
the oil and I gave the blessing. Then I got a spiritual bomb dropped
on me. I literally just started and words just flowed out. I cant
really explain it. The spirit was so strong. There was no way any of
the words were mine. When we ended, I looked up and all the Hermanas
were crying, so I figured that it was a good enough job. Strengthened
my testimony for sure. Another cool thing happened in soccer. We were
playing and there was this kid sitting out. 18 years old, super quiet
and shy, nearly bald. Not the most confidence. I asked him why he
wasnt playing and he decided to come play with us. The whole time I
just called him new guy and tried to make it fun, just regular bagley
stuff. After he came up to me and said "elder bagley, I just wanted to
thank you for making that more fun than sports usually are for me.
Thanks". Literally, I felt so good I could run through a wall. I
figured if that made me happy, giving people the gospel might kill me
with happiness. I´m trying to think what else to say. Right now we
have 8 people in a room, cause there are so many missionaries. In my
room is me and EC, Elder Pacheco from Columbia and Elder Leon from
Vegas, but he speaks spanish. Pachecho rarely talks and Leon is cool.
He is a funny guy and it is useful to have a translator. The North
Americans are Gygi from Brighton, played for Sparta...and Elder Miles.
Miles is 6 4 and is gonna play Linebacker at Boise State after the
mission. His first name is Duncan too. The other latinos are Elder
Osorio, a 26 year old peruvian that has been a member for 16 months.
Dropped everything for the gospel and a mission. His companion is
Elder Aquije, funniest kid ever. He just repeats every english word
like a parrot. He says stuff like "what the frost, come at me bro,
give me five, I know jujitsu, get on my level, what happens in vegas"
and a bunch of other stuff. He is what keeps me going at this point. I
am definitely ready to get out in the field. We go tracting one last
time on saturday and then to the field. Classes are hard cause
everyone is just ready to go.Our teachers are great though. I got the
Dear Elders from Grandma and Edie. So I guess it took like 3ish weeks.
Good luck to Seth and matt at their farewell/homecomings. I just
realized this morning that it was this sunday. I think this is all for
this week. Obviously, next week will be busier as Ill be in a
different country with a different companion doin work. For your
weekly does of scripture, I was ready 2 Nephi 4 this week. I was
impressed just cause Nephi is literally almost perfect, but he is
sitting there worrying about his sins. It shows that no matter who we
are, the atonement is for everyone as we all sin. Anyways, church is
true. I´m excited to actually go change lives and be a Cochabambino.
Love you all and in the words of Aquije "I lof the gospel"
Love,
   Elder Bagley aka blaklick or blagleg or whatever else the latinos
say instead of Bagley</small></p>

                        <p>I'm now in the final week. Weird at this time next week I'll be in Bolivia, actually being a missionary. Crazy that I've been gone for over a month. I'm trying to think of what happened today, but not much. We taught 2 lessons, both pretty good ones. I used 2 Ne 25:26 in both "we speak of Christ...". Overall just pretty good. I keep getting pranked by Fuller and Hess and stuff. It's funny. The funniest thing of the whole day is Aquije. He's the funniest. He says thing like: prayer is oration, what does that mean is what is that signification, he sings all the time, he thinks Hma. Hanson is his girlfriend/favorite food, he says "what's up man, check it out, tapout, I love you, fruta, come at me bro, and other stuff. He's so funny it hurts at times. Today was just a quick day that I don't remember much about. 35 days down, 7 to go. Decided that we'd make an intramural v-ball team when we get back, so hopefully that happens.</p>

                        <p>Uhhhhh... I'm ready to get out of here. Every night in class I just wanna run my head through a brick wall. I'm just ready to get to the field. The classes are just tedious at this point. I'm gonna miss all the people here, but that place itself not that much. It's definitely time to go. I memorized D&C 20:37 in spanish, so that was good. I started work on an analogy for the mission, but I'm not done yet. I'm through that Isaiah chapters in 2nd Nephi too, so I'm hopefully gonna get more into it now. I definitely need P-day tomorrow. Crazy that it is my last one. I just asked the Latinos what to write. Osorio (who is 26) told me to write the things of the heart, Aquije said to write that he can speak english. The former is more true, but Aquije is pretty solid. All I know is that there isn't anything in the world to convince me that the church isn't true. I don't have an overwhelming testimony, but if I were told I had to pick one way or the other about the church, and if I was wrong I'd die, I'd go with the church. I have the desire and belief, I just need the absolute knowledge.</p>

                        <p>For the day: It was good. Machuca came to the temple, played so well in soccer, rainbowed Fuller, devotional with Elder Calderón, played soccer with Miles, Gygi, and Leon. Life is good. Saw Rachel Langston at the temple, bought a tie for Griff.<br><br> El último p-day¿Qué en el mundo? Lo siente como hemos estado aqui para solo 2 semanas. Es loco. Está un poco mas loco que puedo escribir todas de estas palabras en español. 5 semanas antes, no creía que lo fue posible. Mi español no es perfecto, pero yo cero que todos pueden entender. Yo creo que escribiré todo de este parte de mi diario en español. ¿Porqué no, si? Estoy tratando a usar español, per es difícil porque yo solo sé las palabras para enseñar las lecciones del evangelio. Otras palabras son mas difícil para usar porque no apredemos palabras del mundo. Todo mi español es mismo. Yo espero (no estoy seguro) que mi español será mejor por el campo, pero ahora está bien ¿Qué más hay para decir? Cuando leo este parte en el futuro, yo creo que reiré, porque mi español es terrible. Pero está bien. Yo sé que la iglesia es verdadera. Las escrituras, los profetas, las enseñanzas, y todo del evangelio son verdadero tambien. Estoy animado para llegar a ser mejor en español en el futuro.</p>

                        <p>Today was the last day of classes. Crazy stuff. We took a bunch of pictures, and my camera died. We taught the Latinos in some practice lessons, Elder Roman (smoothest Latino) and Elder Mananeta. Our spanish was pretty solid. I understood 85-90% of the spanish. I'm pretty surprised with myself. We also had exist interviews with the president. For physical activity, we started with volleyball, basketball, then finally actually plaed soccer. It was solid. I definitely made my work in soccer. Everyone in the youngest group only knows me cause of soccer. I was definitely one of the top gringos here, with Elder Harwood, Hermana Fuller, Elder Benson (who looks like James Franco) and a few others. Good enough. I also got to give another blessing. Hermana Fuller was sick and what not, so she wanted a blessing. The spirit didn't hit me like a wall like the first time, but it was still there. One thing I said before, when they (Hess/Fuller) were choosing who would give the blessing, I said it didn't matter cause it's not our blessing or our words. Tomorrow will be fun. Proselytizing. Me, Mendoza (bilingual) and Wilkonson. Equipo de sueños<br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>Solo 2 dias más... I'm so ready to be done. I'm so done with the CCM. I was cringing today in class just cause certain Hma's (not Fuller, Hess, Carver, Hanson, or Heinrich) and killing me. Nothing I do is good enough for them. My emotions are: AH!!!! Enough about that. Just a bit of venting. We went proselytizing today. I was with Mendoza y Wilkinson. We went to Carapongo. Super poor. The "chapel" only had a roof for most of it, but it wasn't fully closed off. We taught about 4-6 people, handed out 3 BoMs, and I did the majority of the talking. First 2 contacts, I talked 90% of the time. It was weird being more concerned about the doctrine than spanish. One family, a mom and daughter, were ready. They wanted to hear it and they were receptive. Their relatives were members, so I have the feeling they'll progress. Today was harder and easier than last time, can't explain. Tomorrow is the last Sunday, some will probably shed tears. <u>Side note</u> Some guy was a catholic that didn't believe in God, just dirt, water, and sun. Also apparently he thinks mormons killed catholics and stole 20,000 bricks of gold. Not sure that happened.</p>

                        <p>1 more day. Just one more day. Now it is sad. I'm gonna miss these people so much. It's crazy that I've known them for 6 weeks, some for 2, and we're like best friends. Crazy how the gospel can do that. Today was the last sunday. We had a testimony meeting in our district. I talked about how happy I've been here and how I've changed. I talked about Griffin and how I told him that he'd better not be there when I get back. I could've cried if I let myself. Hess and Fuller cried, so I guess I did well. In church, 106 sang "God be with you till we meet again" and it was powerful (Toomer, Bowyer, Hill, Christenson, etc.) We also sang that in our farewell meeting. Good song. I'm definitely gonna miss the people here so much. They're greater than I could've ever hoped. Oh, Christensen's foot is healing faster than expected #priesthoodpower. I'm so happy that I'm here in the CCM, and I know everything that has happened here has happened for a reason. God has a plan in place for everything.</p>

                        <p>Last time. Insane how the time flew. 6 weeks ago I was at Superman with the family, and now I'm about to leave Peru for Bolivia. I'm gonna miss it here. Especially the people. Everyone that has written in the other pages has had an impact on my life. Today was the longest day, all of it in the auditorium. We had a bunch of pictures tonight and sad leaving of the district. I'm gonna miss them so much. I've never been able to get along with girls so well, but they were awesome. We sang "God be with you till we meet again" with the whole crew, and it was awesome. My testimony has grown so much here. I'm a completely changed person for the better. I'm so grateful for the CCM, but I'm so ready to hit Bolivia. I'm sure I'll have more emotions on the plane tomorrow, but I need sleep and my hand hurts, so hasta mañana.</p>
