            <h1>Week 5 <small>(July 18, 2013)</small></h1>
            <h3>Wilford Bagley</h3>
            <p><small>Hola erbody,
 I dont really know where to start. This last week has been pretty
busy. We have gone through a new group of missionaries and now we are
the oldest. Pretty crazy stuff. It is crazy around here now. The CCM
is usually supposed to hold no more than 120, with 164 absolute
maximum. There are 171 this week. It is crowded. Our room has 8 beds
now instead of 6. 8 people in one room that is smaller than my college
dorm. The mission age change really did a lot. I will miss the old
roomies, but not as much as the first ones. They were just too quiet.
I got along really well with some of the latinos from across the hall.
I kept telling them that I was gonna get 2000 baptisms on saturday, so
they either called me big bagley, or Wilford Bagley like Wilford
Woodruff. Obviously, the biggest part of the week was that we got to
go tracting. They put us with latino companions, so I went with Elder
Ramos my roomie from Columbia. We went to a place called Santa Anita,
a little suburb of Lima. It was definitely a different experience.
Just getting out there and only speaking spanish for 4 hours was
something else. We mostly hung around a park. It was crazy how
welcoming people were. We would just start talking to someone and 90%
of the time theyd be ok with us teaching them for 10-20 minutes. In 4
hours we got 8 contacts, taught about 4 lessons, handed out a bunch of
pamphlets, and placed one BoM. I have a bunch of experiences to share,
but I will just stick with the 3 best/worst ones. First cool thing was
with a guy named Pedro. We had been teaching another old guy, 66 he
was turning 67 a few days later and he kept reminding us. He hated the
USA, so that was fun. He was devout Catholic, but he listened to us.
We gave him a Plan of Salvation and Restoration pamphlet and figured
we were done with him. We went over and started teaching Pedro the
same things. Out of no where the other guy came back and started
asking me about communicating with God and kept telling me that we
cant directly communicate through. So Im telling him that we can and
stuff, and then Pedro jumps in and tells him that through prayer and
prophets we communicate with God. It was cool that a guy we just
barely taught was teaching someone else. As we left they kept talking
for 15-20 minutes. Second was this crazy guy. No more than 2 teeth,
like 70 years old. I thought everything was good, but then he just
kept talking and talking. It went on for like 30 minutes. After we
left I asked Ramos what he said and apparently he was just calling us
liars the whole time. Definitely didnt understand that part. Oh well.
Lastly was our last lesson. I told Ramos that I wasnt gonna let
anything stop me from placing a BoM. We saw this family sitting on the
curb. We talked to them for a while and found out missionaries had
given them a BoM before, but they lost it. We talked about the
Restoration and finally I got to place a BoM. I told the dad that a
good Chapter was 3 Ne 11, so he ripped a piece of newspaper off and
put it in the BoM. It felt so good knowing that I couldve been
changing someones life right then. It was a really tiring day, but it
is more satisfying than staying in a room. Other than tracting,
important things are that I am not DL anymore, sad day. Our new
roomies are pretty cool. 3.5 latinos and 2.5 americans. There is a
latino from Vegas that speaks both. One of the 2 white guys went to
bingham, and he is gonna play Linebacker for Boise State after the
mission. He is huge. All are nice though. Our class has been trying to
speak spanish most the time, but that has only kinda worked. Spanish
is definitely improving, like always. We got our missionary coaching
from our teacher this week, but just like last time, they told us that
me and christensen are doing great and they cant see any apparent
flaws, even though there are definitely some in everyone. It makes me
feel good that I am doing well. We learned this week that emails can
help out those that read them at home so pay attention. The things I
have really been hit with this week are that the gospel is simple, and
that I have the power to change these peoples lives forever. The
gospel isnt really as hard as people make it out to be. We just need
faith in Christ, belief in the scriptures, and belief in prophets,
past and present. Everything else is just based off those things. When
it comes to the people, I have got to realize that I am meeting them
for a reason. Even if they dont imediately accept, I am planting a
seed. I am trying to see people as Christ would, just pure love.
Everyone here is so nice, so I can just be open about the gospel with
them. Spanish is tough at times, but as long as I try, my mouth will
be filled. So ya... church is true. More true than anything. It is
weird that I have 12 days left. Tuesday morning I fly out. There is a
chance I can call home tuesday or wednesday, but I am not sure. We
have heard we might just fly to La Paz and then drive to Cochabamba.
Not sure how I feel about that. This is all for this week. Love you
all whoever you are and I know this church is true.
Love, Elder Bagley
P.S my district is the best. Me Christensen and 8 Hermanas going to
chiclayo. They are: Hermanas Ashley Larsen, Sunny Grant, Ashley
Hanson, Michele Reid, Kimber Hess, Maria Fuller, Kaylee Carver and
Rachel Heinrich. Heinrich says she recognizes you(mom and dad) not
sure why. Anyways, they are all great.

P.S.S me and elder price are holding a districts christmas tree for
ransom, but they dont know it is us. We have been leaving notes and
stuff. Pretty sly. Also, I am best friends with like 8 teachers now.
Latinos are the best

                        <p>Well, today was the fastest tuesday. Nuestros maestros dijieron que no debemos usar ingles, solo español todo el dia. No se como siento sobre este plan. I decided to use español solo en la clase y con mi compañero. Otherwise, I will use both. I figure that I might go crazy speaking just spanish, and I don't wanna be frustrated everyday as I am happy right now. I don't wanna throw myself over the edge. Today was lonely without Latinos. We are supposed to get more missionaries than we can hold, 171/164 so they have added more beds. Crazy stuff. My spanish is definitely improving right now. I'd say I'm in like the 90th percentile. We had a great discussion in class about why we are here. It made me realize that to give up myself doesn't mean being a new person, just using the tool I have to do the Lord's work. I'm called because the attributes I have. Countdown starts, 14 days left. <u>SIDE NOTE:</u> Me and Elder Price are holding district 109's christmas tree for ransom anonomosly. <-(no se) It should be fun.</p>

                        <p>Um... we now have 8 beds in our room. We haven't had more than 2 roomates, so 6 would be very different. The mission age change has affected the CCM. Usually there isn't more than 120 missionaries, and they're expecting 170 this week. It'll be weird. Glad I'm done in 2 weeks. Today had a lot of spanish. I'm not speaking just spanish, but I shoot for 60-70%. I'm getting more comfortable. Our new roomie is Elder Pecheco (not sure) from Columbia. He's normal I guess. Class was aight. We got to watch a great Elder Bednar video on light and a mormon message about Tyler Haws. We got "coaching" from our teacher, but both times that has happened, they just tell us to help out everyone else and that we are doing great. It helps the confidence, but I'd like things to work on. Oh well, está bien. Tomorrow is the 2nd to last p-day here, kinda weird. I'm gonna miss a lot of the stuff about this place. The field is where the action starts though. <u>SIDE NOTE</u>: We left a ransom note for Dist. 109, they didn't seem happy. Let the games continue...</p>

                        <p>Well today was interesting to say the least. We woke up to 6 roomates, so that'll be different. We have 2.5 Latinos, and 3.5 north americans. There is a guy from Vegas that is fluent in both. Americans are Elder Gygi from Cottonwood Heights, and Elder Miles from South Jordan. Miles is playing linebacker at Boise State when he gets back, he's a big guy. One of the Latinos is 26, he's only been a member for 16 months. Different than me. We went to the temple and such cause it was p-day. We came back and played a bunch of sports. We were playing soccer and Christensen roled his ankle pretty bad. It was swelling like crazy. He's on crutches now. Hope he gets better quickly. After class we got everyone of the Elders in our group together and gave him a blessing. 13 elders giving a blessing is powerful. I got the privelage of giving the blessing, my first one ever. It was incredible. The Spirit was so strong. I literally started and words just came. Can't deny that they were words specific for E' Christensen. I was shaking it was so strong. A lot of the Hermanas were crying after. Needless to say, great way to end the night. Strengthened my testimony for sure.</p>

                        <p>I swear I have been sick forever. I can't remember not having a cough. Today was ok. Played soccer at gym and that was fun. I don't always have much to say during the normal days cause everything is the same. We did have a pretty good testimony meeting/discussion with our district. We just talked about what reasons we had for going on a mission. It was cool and eye-opening. People I thought were just perfect people have had some tough things happen in their lives. Missions have had a huge impact on their lives. Made me realize how blessed I was and am. Around 8 I just had huge stomach pains. I was banging my head on the wall cause I was hurting so bad. I think the class was suprised I was pretty quiet. I'm almost 100% now. I really like my roommates. The north americans are great, Leon from Vegas is getting better. Osorio from Peru is just super happy all the time. Elder Aquije from ? is super funny. He just repeats all the english he hears "what's up" "check it out" "come at me bro" it's super funny. Glad everyone is cool.<br><br><br><br><br><br> </p>

                        <p>Some interesting things happened today. Me and Elder Christensen went to talk to the doctor. I either have a prolonged cold virus or bronchitis, and he has a grade 2 ankle sprain, meaning ligaments tore. He's not gonna be full strength till September. That's pretty hard. He's pretty bummed it semms. During the morning I decided to be quiet just to see how everyone would react. EVeryone was depressed by lunch, so I think I should talk. We are having a fast for Elder Christensen in our district. During soccer today, something made me so happy. We were just playing like usual, but we were playing with this new elder, Elder Olsen. He's 18, balding, and just a odd kid. Naturally, I tried to include him, like a lot. Just to make it fun for him. After it was over he came up to me and said "thank you for making sports more fun for me than they usually are". I made me feel so good I could break both legs and still be happy. If helping one kid did that, helping people in the field will be awesome. I'm starting to love my roomates. Pacheco, Leon, Miles, Gygi, Osorio, Aquije, Christensen, and me. It's great in here, having 8. It's crazy it's only been 3 days.</p>

                        <p>It's Sunday... I don't really have anything special to say about it. I like Sunday's and I don't They are relaxing, but they take a long time. Today was the 2nd to last Sunday. 8 days and I will be in the field. Crazy. This Sunday I got the "privelage" of giving a talk in spanish. It was good enough. We also got to do the prelude music for a fireside, that we had to listen to just in spanish. It wasn't too bad. Overall today I learned that a knowledge of God and his love is #1 for investigators. I don't really have much else to say because it was Sunday. Not a bad day, just not a lot to talk about. <br> <br> <u>Side Note:</u> Me, Price, Underwood, Harwood, Bowyer, Whitlock, and Rutter devised an inception plan. Also we "learned" to direct music, but me and Elder Rutter just had fun with it. Good stuff.</p>

                        <p>I'm starting to run out of things to write hear in the CCM. It's just that everyday is the same. Only a week left though. Kinda crazy. Today was fast, but boring kind of. Class was ok. One of the cool things was I got to be a pretend investigator for Hmo. Machuca. It's not like a big deal, but it was cool to be able to speak that much spanish. Also a cool thing was that Elder Aquije said a prayer in english, with help from Elder Miles. Aquije is like a parrot with english. It's crazy. Today seemed like a good day for Elder Christensen, which is good. We took our big group picture, which was as big or bigger than any other North American group before. Overall, a good day I guess. I was reading 2 Ne 4 today and it impressed me that even though Nephi is a better person than I could dream of being, he is still tormented by his sins. It just shows me that we all need the atonement, no matter who we are.</p>
