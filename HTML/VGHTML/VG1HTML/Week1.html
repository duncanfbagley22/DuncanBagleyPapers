            <h3>High on a Mountain Top</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
    Well this week was full of a lot of change. Obviously, just being in my new area. I name it High on a Mountain Top because our area is just the side of the mountain. Just walking around normal is exhausting, because it's basically hiking all day. Also, the sun beats down pretty hard all day. That being said, I love my area (just the people). Physically I hate my area, but with the people and the work, it's awesome. The ward is really really good. For the first time in my mission, I have a ward mission leader that works well and isn't lazy. There's just a great feeling in the whole ward. We live in a pretty solid house. It's the first time in my whole mission where I've lived just as 2 missionaries instead of 4, but it's fine. My comp's great, we haven't had any problems and he helps me a bunch. The whole zone leader thing is a little bit weird. I don't really feel like a zone leader, more just the comp of the zone leader. Our zone has some really good people, but as always there are people that arent as great. It's not super hard though. My pensionista makes very Bolivian food (lots of potatoes and rice and there's always a ton of food), but she's the nicest person ever. I'd much rather prefer having a pensionista like that than a good cook that just gets annoyed by the missionaries. She lives basically as high up as possible, so walking there is a pain. Anyways, there's the full run down of the area, here's what happened this week.
<br><br>
Tuesday- We woke up at... 3:30am. We had to do the whole transfers thingy and we spent a lot of time in the airport. It was sad to see a bunch of my friends go home (including all the sister missionaries that got here the same time as me). We got to meet the new guys and stuff. It was a pretty busy day, but not too exciting.
<br><br>
Wednesday- Just more of the same stuff. We went up to the Cristo statue and talked a little. Then we were just at the mission home for a training thing. I'm going to miss eating there all the time. That night I also had to pack, which is always a pain. I hope it's the last time I have to do it before I go home.
<br><br>
Thursday- Finished packing and then Laidlaw came and got my. We headed to our area and I got settled in. We had to go back to the office for the little zone leader meeting thing, but this time I was on the other side of the desk. It was a little weird. That night we had a lesson with a new guy named Alfredo. He is a member's friend and he is really good. We were able to invite him to baptism and he understood really well. Afterwords we had a little missionary meeting and talked to our ward mission leader.
<br><br>
Friday- I completed 18 months, so that's weird. A year and a half. Firstly we had a lesson with a kid named Kevin. He always is really good and we invited him to be baptized. In the afternoon we taught the Flia Arce, a less active family. They live super high up in the area, so it was a long walk. We went with a member named Alvaro that helps us out a ton. He's probably gone with us like 3 times in the week I've been here. Finally at night, we had a lesson with the Flia Arrazola. They are converts of Elder Laidlaw and they are awesome. They are SUPER active and are a great family. Definitely some of the cooler people I've met here.
<br><br>
Saturday- In morning we had a service project with the Elder's Quorum. We helped make Roscas, which are cake/bread thingys. It was pretty fun. After that we went with Alvaro and the EQ President to teach Marlon. He's already got all the lessons and knows everyone at church. He just needs to get married so he can get baptized. After lunch we taught a bunch of lessons and at night we taught Alfredo again. He read his homework like 3 times and understood well. He wouldve come to church yesterday, but he went out of town.
<br><br>
Sunday- We had church at 8 (I'm tired of 8 o clock church). The ward is big and everyone is friendly. We had one investigator at church, but also like 8 less active people. For the 3rd hour, we just went out and delivered the cake things we made to less active members. In the afternoon we just had one lesson. We taught this guy named Richard and his wife Gladys. They are less actives and are awesome. Richard served a mission in Quito, but he had some problems with the bishop. He's a really big dude and has like 7 dogs. One is named Machete and I think it could kill me. Super nice dogs though. We talked to them and found out that Richard asked the bishop for an interview. Huge step. With that they could be officially reactivated this week. During the lesson the Relief Society ladies came and gave Gladys a cake. We finished up the lesson at 5:45. We had a mission conference at 6 and we ran (like we literally ran) to get there as fast as possible. Somehow we got there at 5:59, which was a miracle. President directed a conference for all of Cocha, and it was pretty cool. Later we had a ward devotional. Us missionaries sang and it wasn't too bad. Busy day.
<br><br>
Monday- Today we just bought some food, played soccer with the guys from my old zone (our zone won). Not sure what the plan is for tonight yet.
<br><br>
So that's the week. Pretty different compared to the past weeks, but I liked it. Being a regular missionary is a lot more gratifying. I love you guys so much, and I cant wait to see you on Thursday.<br>
Love,<br>
   Elder Bagley</small></p>
