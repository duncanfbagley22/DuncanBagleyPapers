            <h1>Week 4 <small>(January 12, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>Elder Bagley's Log: day 572</h3>
            <p><small>Dearly beloved,<br>
     This was a good week. Not a ton of stuff went on as far as the work was concerned, but I learned a lot this week. Our numbers went a little downhill, but I really do feel like it was a week of learning. This is why...
<br><br>
Monday- We had an FHE with these people named Cesar and Lijia. They are less actives, and a little frustrating. The wife is pretty solid, but her husband is kinda lame. We talked about the gospel of Christ, and they understand well, but they just get lazy a lot or make excuses. That night I also got kinda sick and had to go to the bathroom there. If there's one thing I wont miss about Bolivia, it'll be going to bathrooms that are basically just broken toilets that you manually flush with buckets of water and are in an adobe hut and have no lights and it's 8 at night. Ya...
<br><br>
Tuesday- We had the consejo de lideres. From 10-5 we had a conference with all the zone leaders, sister trainer leaders, assistants, and the hansens. We talked about a bunch of stuff, but the 2 main things were about teaching with the spirit and how to be a good companion. I really like learning from President and seeing all the missionaries. 8 of the people that got to the mission on the same day as me were there, so it was cool to see all them. I really liked the consejo and I'm excited for the next one (they're every month). That night it also rained super hard. We got pretty wet and showed up to our WML's house like that. He's one of the cooler people I know here and he is great to work with.
<br><br>
Wednesday- Just a regular day for the most part. We had a few lessons, but none of the people are really progressing. We have people to teach, but we just want to find people that will progress. That night we had a ward activity night thing. There was a lot of people there and it went well. We played some games and stuff and everyone seemed to enjoy it.
<br><br>
Thursday- Another regular day. We looked for some people and found one new lady named Viviana. She's talked to the missionaries before, so she knows a little. She fell through on the follow up appointment, so that was disappointing. We'll see what happens. That night we had ward counsel. It's pretty solid. We got up and talked about this recent convert kid, and we found out that the YM president had taken him to the temple that week and visited his family. We have really good leaders in this ward. 
<br><br>
Friday- We had the zone meeting and me and E Laidlaw had to teach the 90min class. We just went over what we talked about in the consejo and it went really well. After that we went to the offices to do our finances, and that night we had a dinner with all the leaders in the ward. The bishop likes working and all the other leaders are good too, we just need to find people for them to work with.
<br><br>
Saturday- Kind of a tough day. We had 6 appointments fall through, but we did teach a few lessons. We met a guy named Pablo that shows some promise. Problem is that he is going to go to Chile this week, so we'll see what happens there. 
<br><br>
Sunday- Decent day. Church was good, but we didnt have any investigators show up. After church and lunch we had a lesson with Marlon and his girlfriend Jhanet. She is a member and he is an investigator. He is probably our best one right now. She just gets sick all the time so they dont go to church. Other than going to church, they are pretty solid and read and stuff. We have an FHE with them tonight, so hopefully it goes well. Our other lesson was with a guy named Ariel. I assumed I've mentioned him before, but he is a guy we met knocking doors. Come to find out he is a pretty important member of another church. He knows a ton about the bible, but he doesnt really bible bash. We dont know if he is interested to find out if it is true or just to find out about the church though. I learned probably my most important lesson of the week there. After trying to answer questions with the bible, we just figured that EVERYTHING we do goes through the Book of Mormon. That's why they tell us so much about the Book of Mormon and how we should get a testimony about it and talk about it. We can answer questions with the bible, and the church is true according to the bible, but we cant gain a real spiritual testimony of the trueness of the restored gospel unless we know the Book of Mormon is true. Not knowing in a physical, scientific, or moral sense, but spiritually. That's why we need it. I cant really explain it all perfectly, but I understand now. He's not against reading the Book of Mormon, so that's good. We'll see how it goes, but even if he doesnt progress, at least I learned my lesson. I've heard it thousands of times, but I finally came to really really understand the WHY yesterday.
<br><br>
Today- Nothing special, just going to relax probably. 
<br><br>
So ya, that's what happened. We were really busy with meetings this week, but this next week we dont have much, so hopefully we can get some stuff going. I'm sure it'll work out how it should, as long as we work. Love you guys, and we'll be talkin next week.<br>
Love,<br>
  Elder Bagley

                        <p>Consejo day!!! The Consejo de lideres is a lot more enjoyable as an actual leader. We got there early and ate breakfast. We talked to E’ Valerio and E’ Skousen a lot, because we are going to live together after the mission. The consejo itself was great. We talked a lot about teaching with the spirit and having the spirit, which really is the key to success in missionary work. We also learned about being a good companion and stuff like that. I really liked learning first hand from President and the APs. Hopefully I can become better with this stuff. After that, cinnamon rolls, and dinner, we went to our mission leader meeting. It was raining super hard, but we eventually got there. He's (mission leader) super cool, be WML I've had. Anyways, no lessons today, but it was pretty productive.</p>

                        <p>Back to work day. It's always tough to wake up, but today was especially hard. After studying, we went out to work. We couldn't really find much in the morning, but we did talk to Marlon after lunch. He works in a dentist's office, actually he's a dentist, so we just teach there. He's still good, just too many problems with his girlfriend. After that, we talked to Daniela, a recent convert/menos activo. Finally, we had a lesson with Cesar and Richard and Gladys's house. We talked about the BoM. He's good, we just have to explain things really well. To end the night we had a Noche de Hermanamiento. There was a good amount of people there, and it was fun, so mission accomplished. Anyways, good day, workin hard.</p>

                        <p>Today was decent I guess. The morning was a little long, just cause we had studying and weekly planning. Weekly planning just isn't the funnest thing in the world. After going to lunch, we had a few lessons. First we talked with a lady named Escarlet. She's a little strange, but a nice lady. She's less active. After that we talked to Felix, another less active. He's pretty good, we got a reference out of him. Finally, we met a new investigator named Viviana. She's an antiguo investigator, but she's pretty good. We had 2 appts fall through in the afternoon, but we did have consejo. Our ward is really good. People here actually work, without us telling them. I see a lot of potential in this ward.</p>

                      <p>For how I thought today was going to go, it actually turned out well. In the morning we had zone meeting. It was my first time doing a big zone class, and I think it went pretty well. We talked about a bunch of stuff, but mostly about teaching with the spirit. Being ZL is helping me to get more comfortable talking to lots of people. After lunch, we had piano lessons (waste of time) and then we went to the office to do financiero. Back in our area after that, we went to go see Richard and Gladys, cause Gladys had her baby yesterday. Luckily there we met their friend Vladimir and taught him a little. Then we had a short lesson with Jhery and Veronica, and then we went to the chapel. There was a ward leadership dinner thing. Our leaders were great, I'm really excited to keep working here.<br><br></p>

                    <p>Today turned out kinda bad. The morning was cold, so that was a bad start. Both of our morning appointments fell through. We ended up just talking to this lady named Maria. Nice lady, but a little crazy. She thinks we're good, but she told us that she'd never change churches, but she's gonna tell people about us and that we're good. After lunch, we talked to Kevin. Lesson was iffy, but it was kind of cool when Kevin threw a rock like 20 yds to hit a cat. After that we had an interesting lesson. There's this guy named Pablo. At the beginning of the lesson, he seemed so humble and great. He'd been kicked out of his house and all that. However, in the middle of the class he just went crazy. Just going off about how baptism for the dead is wrong and just being annoying. Then at the end, he went back to normal. Weird. Other than that, we had a total of 5 lessons fall through. Oh well, learning experience.</p>

                    <p>Today was… well just today.  Church was good. We didn't have any investigators at church, so that stinks. I'm pretty warmed up to the ward now, so it's good. We had a lesson on cleaning the church, interesting… After church, we got a ride home from the Flia Rivero (coolest family in the ward), and had lunch. After lunch we had a lesson with Marlon and Jhanet.  I think it was really good that we got to talk to both at the same time. After that, we went over and talked to Richard for a bit. He's looking for a house now, cause his owner needs him out. Really hope they find a house in our area. We ended the day with Ariel. We explained the Restoration and just talked… for like 2 hours. He's got so many questions, and bases everything off the bible. He's got it like memorized. He's a good guy, though, and isn't really Bible bashing, just is curious and says what he knows. Who knows what’ll happen with him. All I know is that he needs to read the BoM. That's the secret.</p>

                    <p>P-day!!!. Actually, the p-day portion wasn’t super exciting. We woke up, did studies, and all that. I listen to some talks on the BoM, because the truthfulness of the BoM has become my main focus. It really is the secret. BoM + the spirit = testimony and conversion. After that, we did internet, printed off some pictures, and then tried to get Laidlaw's SD card from this guy named Milhouse. He apparently lost it. I was kind of mad, but Laidlaw was surprisingly calm. After that, we made our way to Luigi's again (Luigi Circuit) for lunch. We ate (saw Hna Torrico who is now an RM, kinda weird), went to buy groceries, and then we saw Davis and Vega and talked to them for a while. At night we had an FHE with Marlon and Jhanet. Sergio (the EQ pres) and his wife came too. We talked about obedience and it went really well. He's close to baptism, just missing a little. We also played this card game that Laidlaw has and it was fun. Honestly, the best part of p-day was working. Unusual, but good.</p>
