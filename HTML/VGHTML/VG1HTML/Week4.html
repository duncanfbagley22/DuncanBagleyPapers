            <h1>Week 4 <small>(January 12, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>Elder Bagley's Log: day 572</h3>
            <p><small>Dearly beloved,<br>
     This was a good week. Not a ton of stuff went on as far as the work was concerned, but I learned a lot this week. Our numbers went a little downhill, but I really do feel like it was a week of learning. This is why...
<br><br>
Monday- We had an FHE with these people named Cesar and Lijia. They are less actives, and a little frustrating. The wife is pretty solid, but her husband is kinda lame. We talked about the gospel of Christ, and they understand well, but they just get lazy a lot or make excuses. That night I also got kinda sick and had to go to the bathroom there. If there's one thing I wont miss about Bolivia, it'll be going to bathrooms that are basically just broken toilets that you manually flush with buckets of water and are in an adobe hut and have no lights and it's 8 at night. Ya...
<br><br>
Tuesday- We had the consejo de lideres. From 10-5 we had a conference with all the zone leaders, sister trainer leaders, assistants, and the hansens. We talked about a bunch of stuff, but the 2 main things were about teaching with the spirit and how to be a good companion. I really like learning from President and seeing all the missionaries. 8 of the people that got to the mission on the same day as me were there, so it was cool to see all them. I really liked the consejo and I'm excited for the next one (they're every month). That night it also rained super hard. We got pretty wet and showed up to our WML's house like that. He's one of the cooler people I know here and he is great to work with.
<br><br>
Wednesday- Just a regular day for the most part. We had a few lessons, but none of the people are really progressing. We have people to teach, but we just want to find people that will progress. That night we had a ward activity night thing. There was a lot of people there and it went well. We played some games and stuff and everyone seemed to enjoy it.
<br><br>
Thursday- Another regular day. We looked for some people and found one new lady named Viviana. She's talked to the missionaries before, so she knows a little. She fell through on the follow up appointment, so that was disappointing. We'll see what happens. That night we had ward counsel. It's pretty solid. We got up and talked about this recent convert kid, and we found out that the YM president had taken him to the temple that week and visited his family. We have really good leaders in this ward. 
<br><br>
Friday- We had the zone meeting and me and E Laidlaw had to teach the 90min class. We just went over what we talked about in the consejo and it went really well. After that we went to the offices to do our finances, and that night we had a dinner with all the leaders in the ward. The bishop likes working and all the other leaders are good too, we just need to find people for them to work with.
<br><br>
Saturday- Kind of a tough day. We had 6 appointments fall through, but we did teach a few lessons. We met a guy named Pablo that shows some promise. Problem is that he is going to go to Chile this week, so we'll see what happens there. 
<br><br>
Sunday- Decent day. Church was good, but we didnt have any investigators show up. After church and lunch we had a lesson with Marlon and his girlfriend Jhanet. She is a member and he is an investigator. He is probably our best one right now. She just gets sick all the time so they dont go to church. Other than going to church, they are pretty solid and read and stuff. We have an FHE with them tonight, so hopefully it goes well. Our other lesson was with a guy named Ariel. I assumed I've mentioned him before, but he is a guy we met knocking doors. Come to find out he is a pretty important member of another church. He knows a ton about the bible, but he doesnt really bible bash. We dont know if he is interested to find out if it is true or just to find out about the church though. I learned probably my most important lesson of the week there. After trying to answer questions with the bible, we just figured that EVERYTHING we do goes through the Book of Mormon. That's why they tell us so much about the Book of Mormon and how we should get a testimony about it and talk about it. We can answer questions with the bible, and the church is true according to the bible, but we cant gain a real spiritual testimony of the trueness of the restored gospel unless we know the Book of Mormon is true. Not knowing in a physical, scientific, or moral sense, but spiritually. That's why we need it. I cant really explain it all perfectly, but I understand now. He's not against reading the Book of Mormon, so that's good. We'll see how it goes, but even if he doesnt progress, at least I learned my lesson. I've heard it thousands of times, but I finally came to really really understand the WHY yesterday.
<br><br>
Today- Nothing special, just going to relax probably. 
<br><br>
So ya, that's what happened. We were really busy with meetings this week, but this next week we dont have much, so hopefully we can get some stuff going. I'm sure it'll work out how it should, as long as we work. Love you guys, and we'll be talkin next week.<br>
Love,<br>
  Elder Bagley
