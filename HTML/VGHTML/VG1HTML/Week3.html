            <h1>Week 3 <small>(January 5, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>Ruffin' it (Title Courtesy of Elder Laidlaw)</h3>
            <p><small>Dear (Insert Your Name Here),<br>
     I kinda feel like I was writing you yesterday, the weeks go by pretty fast. This week we did work. We worked the hardest that we have since I`ve been here, and we had results. Our main thing this week was that the APs set some goals for all of the zone leaders, and we did our best to meet the goals. We really didnt waste any time, the whole time focusing on those goals. We busted our butts Saturday and Sunday, to a point where we were about ready to collapse. However, we got the goals right before dinner on Sunday. We felt really good. So ya, there`s your inspiring moment of the week, but here`s what happened the rest of the week.
<br><br>
Monday- Cool thing. We were at the grocery store and we met this LDS Bolivian family that lives in California that was visiting. We talked for a bit, they have sons on missions, and then just said by. However, while I was getting our bags, the dad did a sneaky handshake with Laidlaw and slipped him 100bs and ran off. People like that deserve lots of blessings.
<br><br>
Tuesday- Nothing too special, just district meeting and going to the offices. That night I started my intercambio with Elder Vasquez, the AP. He is the humblest kid ever, and I've known him since the MTC, so we get along great. He's a really good elder
<br><br>
Wednesday- We worked in the area called Villa Moscu. It's the area where the temple is and it is super rich. I just gazed at some of the houses wondering what people do to get that kind of money. We didnt have much success cause some appts fell through, but we did contact a bunch of people. Later in the day we went up to a pueblo in their area, and it was super high up. On the way we passed by a gated community that literally has million dollar houses. It was a fun experience to go out with Elder Vasquez and I learned a lot.
<br><br>
Thursday- Nothing super special, just workin hard
<br><br>
Friday- We had 3 different interviews. First with President Hansen. We just talked about what I've learned in the mission, how the zone is doing, and he finalized my go home date (june 3). I really like President Hansen, as well as Hermana Hansen. They are great to work with. Second was that I had to give a baptismal interview to this little girl. Pretty basic stuff, but we had to go way out to Sacaba (like 20-30 minutes away). Finally, Elder Laidlaw had to give an interview in our chapel for another person. Lots of interviews
<br><br>
Saturday- We just worked hard. We needed a lot of lessons that day, but we got them.
<br><br>
Sunday- More hard work. We went out with a member named Alvaro all day. He always helps us and he is great. He is the only active member in his family, and his dream is to go on a mission. Just an inspiring guy
<br><br>
That's the week, here's the people
<br><br>
Marlon: Probably our best investigator. He really wants to get baptized and has a testimony. Problem is that something always comes up on Sunday (girlfriend is sick, girlfriend is travelling, he is travelling). He`ll get baptized one day, we just dont know when
<br><br>
Alfredo: He came to church yesterday. He's good. Not sure how he's doing because Laidlaw taught him during the intercambio.
<br><br>
Flia Garcia: The coolest less actives ever. They are going to have their interviews on Tuesday, so they wont be less active any more, which is great. The wife is probably going to have a baby this week as well
<br><br>
Cesar: He's a reference from the Flia Garcia (dad, the thing you wrote about less actives wanting to share the gospel is so true). He's good, we've only had one lesson though. He already told us that he prayed and knows it's true, so that's good.
<br><br>
Ariel: He's that guy we met knocking doors last Sunday. Found out that he is the owner of a members house and he is a really important guy in some other church. We talked to him on Saturday night. He is really good with the bible and just a smart guy. He doesnt bible bash or anything either. We just dont know if he is really interested, or if he just wants to find out about the church, or if he wants to prove us wrong (which we arent). He asked us if we had a testimony of these things and I bore my testimony and the spirit hit me strong. Good thing our church is the true one
<br><br>
Today we played basketball with some people in the zone. Pretty fun, watching latinos play is always entertaining. Oh ya, the title. 2 funny dog (get it, ruff) moments this week
<br><br>
1) One less active member has a pit bull named Brawly. He is super old, but still a pit bull. We saw him attack another dog this week and full out bit him in the mouth. It was terrifying yet impressive. Not going to mess with him
<br><br>
2) There is a dog that lives at our house that always follows us. Laidlaw gave him the name Trundle. On Sunday, he followed us all the way to church and just waited outside the gate (he didnt wait 3 hours though). He also fought off a pack of 15 dogs by himself. He's the coolest dog ever.
<br><br>
So that's the week. Pretty crazy it's already 2015. We have consejo de lideres this week, so that should be fun. I love you guys a whole lot, and I'll talk to you next week.<br>

                        <p>Today was long. We had district and zone meeting in the morning. It was good enough. The zone is good, just there’s a ton of people. After that we had to go to the pharmacy to buy meds for Elder Garcia. We went with him and Elder Nazareno, who is super funny. Lunch was bad just cause I spilled some soup on my shirt. We went with Ivan and we talked to Marlon. He really wants to get baptized soon. We’re just trying to make sure he’s ready and stuff. I think he’ll make it. After that we went to the offices to do financiero. We waited for a while, but now we are on intercambios with the APs. I’m in Villa Moscu with Elder Vasquez. He’s a really good missionary, so hopefully I can learn a lot from him. We’ll see though, tomorrow should be interesting.</p>

                        <p>Last day of the year.  All day today was spent with Elder Vazquez in Villa Moscu.  Basically, I was assistant for a day. The APs house is super small, but good enough. We studied just normal and then we went out and worked.  It was kinda tough, because E’ Vazquez didn't know the area super well. We got lost quite a bit. We taught this guy named Miguel in a security guard booth. It was a decent lesson. The rest of the time was spent either getting lost in the area or going up places where the people weren't home. We did go with a recent convert up to a pueblo named Andrada. We passed by “los lomos” which is like a millionaire community.  The pueblo was super high up and we got lost a lot. Fun experience though. Although it was a tough intercambio, I learned a lot. Elder Vazquez is one of the humblest people I've ever met and he really tries to be 100% and contact EVERYONE. Definitely stuff I can improve at.</p>

                        <p>Wow, it's 2015. I went through the entire 2014 year as a missionary. This year will be very different. Anyways, the morning was pretty boring. We had weekly planning which is usually pretty boring. After that, we just headed to lunch. After lunch, we had to go teach piano lessons to a somewhat less active girl. Kinda pointless, but we do it because the mom really wants us to. After that we went to work with a kid named Richard. He's a cool kid, but we couldn't find anything. We did get a few contacts, but that was about it. We did teach one lesson to Richard’s (other Richard) less active sister and nieces. I think it went really well. We just tried to get them to understand how important all this is. We ended up getting 3 references too. We ended the day with dinner and then we went to take out money. Quick day, not super productive.</p>

                      <h3>January 2, 2015</h3>
                      <p>Boy, today was busy. In the morning, we had interviews with President Hansen. Mine was pretty good. We talked about the last six months of my mission, the zone, and just stuff like that. He also basically told me that it's a 50-50 chance that Laidlaw is either staying or leaving. After that, we went out to Sacaba where I gave a baptismal interview to a little 9 yr old. We then had a lesson with Kevin. We taught him about the Book of Mormon a little bit. After that we had to go to the chapel because Laidlaw had to give a baptismal interview. We ended the night with two lessons. First, we talked to Jhery and Veronica about enduring to the end. Then we talked to Cesar, this kid Richard and Gladys referred us to. He's an old investigator, and he said he's already prayed and gotten an answer that the church is true. Sweet, anyways busy day, but stressful.<br><br><br></p>

                    <h3>January 3, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Today we, as they would say here, “lo dimos duro.” We had 6 solid lessons, which were: <br>
Felix Olivares: A less active guy that likes church, but he has a lot of doubts. We tried to clear up some
<br>
Marlon: We talked about marriage and baptism. He really wants to, and will be baptized one day. Not sure when.
<br>
Kevin: A recent convert. Really nice kid, we talked about tithing.
<br>
Flia Alanes: A nice, but less active family. They just don’t go to church. We explained why they should.
<br>
Tatiana and Alison: A less active and her nonmember niece. We explained a lot about the BoM, but the dog there wouldn’t stop barking at Alvaro’s, the member that was with us, dog. I hate dogs.
<br>
Ariel: This guy we met knocking doors. Really biblically smart. Still not sure if he’s interested or just wants to put us down. We talked about the BoM. Interesting stuff.
<br>
Other important things of the day were English Classes, a huge lunch, and Laidlaw having an awkward talk with Hna Arce. Busy, tiring day, but we got a lot accomplished and I feel good.
<br>
*Bore my testimony with Ariel. Felt a strong spirit, church is definitely true.

                    <p>Another day of “dandolo duro”.  It was nice to have church at 10. We got up, studied, and it was just relaxing. Church was decent. We only had 1 person, Alfredo, there. Marlon fell through, which was disappointing. We have had these goals of 8 lessons with a member and 20 lessons overall that we got from the APs this week. We already had 8 member lessons, but we need 4 lessons today to hit 20 overall. We had 2 set appts at night, but we needed to find 2 other lessons before 5. But between 3 and 4, we had nothing. At 4 we taught Kevin, an investigator, about the sacrament. After that we went through like 3 places before we found some recent concerts, Mariela and Zulema, to teach. We were with Alvaro all day. He's great and always helps us. We ended the day first with Jhery and Veronica. We watched a video and that was good. Finally, we talked to Richard and Gladys. Gladys is super close to having her baby. We watched the “Expiacion y Obra Misional” movie and talked about it. Really spiritual. We ended up making the goals. Kinda a miracle. I felt good about this week, we did work.</p>

                    <p>P-dizzle fo shizzle. Someday someone will read that and think I'm weird. Today was pretty calm, and relaxing. In the morning we played basketball with the Frutillar, Villa Graciela, and Amancayas missionaries. Watching latinos play basketball is always funny, but overall it really was a good and fun activity. After that, we went and did email. Everything is still good at home. We went to go pick up Laidlaw's USB, but the guy wasn't there (we weren’t happy). We then went to get haircuts and finally to Hipermaxi to buy stuff. For some reason, we then went to give a blessing for the family of some people Laidlaw knew in his first area. I didn't even participate, cause not everyone could go in the room. We ended the day with an FHE, with Cesar and Lijia. They're slowly reactivating. We talked about the gospel of Christ. I almost died because I had to use the bathroom so much. It was a classical bathroom in Bolivia (self explanatory). Tomorrow is the consejo, should be good.</p>
