            <h1>Week 3 <small>(January 5, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>Ruffin' it (Title Courtesy of Elder Laidlaw)</h3>
            <p><small>Dear (Insert Your Name Here),<br>
     I kinda feel like I was writing you yesterday, the weeks go by pretty fast. This week we did work. We worked the hardest that we have since I`ve been here, and we had results. Our main thing this week was that the APs set some goals for all of the zone leaders, and we did our best to meet the goals. We really didnt waste any time, the whole time focusing on those goals. We busted our butts Saturday and Sunday, to a point where we were about ready to collapse. However, we got the goals right before dinner on Sunday. We felt really good. So ya, there`s your inspiring moment of the week, but here`s what happened the rest of the week.
<br><br>
Monday- Cool thing. We were at the grocery store and we met this LDS Bolivian family that lives in California that was visiting. We talked for a bit, they have sons on missions, and then just said by. However, while I was getting our bags, the dad did a sneaky handshake with Laidlaw and slipped him 100bs and ran off. People like that deserve lots of blessings.
<br><br>
Tuesday- Nothing too special, just district meeting and going to the offices. That night I started my intercambio with Elder Vasquez, the AP. He is the humblest kid ever, and I've known him since the MTC, so we get along great. He's a really good elder
<br><br>
Wednesday- We worked in the area called Villa Moscu. It's the area where the temple is and it is super rich. I just gazed at some of the houses wondering what people do to get that kind of money. We didnt have much success cause some appts fell through, but we did contact a bunch of people. Later in the day we went up to a pueblo in their area, and it was super high up. On the way we passed by a gated community that literally has million dollar houses. It was a fun experience to go out with Elder Vasquez and I learned a lot.
<br><br>
Thursday- Nothing super special, just workin hard
<br><br>
Friday- We had 3 different interviews. First with President Hansen. We just talked about what I've learned in the mission, how the zone is doing, and he finalized my go home date (june 3). I really like President Hansen, as well as Hermana Hansen. They are great to work with. Second was that I had to give a baptismal interview to this little girl. Pretty basic stuff, but we had to go way out to Sacaba (like 20-30 minutes away). Finally, Elder Laidlaw had to give an interview in our chapel for another person. Lots of interviews
<br><br>
Saturday- We just worked hard. We needed a lot of lessons that day, but we got them.
<br><br>
Sunday- More hard work. We went out with a member named Alvaro all day. He always helps us and he is great. He is the only active member in his family, and his dream is to go on a mission. Just an inspiring guy
<br><br>
That's the week, here's the people
<br><br>
Marlon: Probably our best investigator. He really wants to get baptized and has a testimony. Problem is that something always comes up on Sunday (girlfriend is sick, girlfriend is travelling, he is travelling). He`ll get baptized one day, we just dont know when
<br><br>
Alfredo: He came to church yesterday. He's good. Not sure how he's doing because Laidlaw taught him during the intercambio.
<br><br>
Flia Garcia: The coolest less actives ever. They are going to have their interviews on Tuesday, so they wont be less active any more, which is great. The wife is probably going to have a baby this week as well
<br><br>
Cesar: He's a reference from the Flia Garcia (dad, the thing you wrote about less actives wanting to share the gospel is so true). He's good, we've only had one lesson though. He already told us that he prayed and knows it's true, so that's good.
<br><br>
Ariel: He's that guy we met knocking doors last Sunday. Found out that he is the owner of a members house and he is a really important guy in some other church. We talked to him on Saturday night. He is really good with the bible and just a smart guy. He doesnt bible bash or anything either. We just dont know if he is really interested, or if he just wants to find out about the church, or if he wants to prove us wrong (which we arent). He asked us if we had a testimony of these things and I bore my testimony and the spirit hit me strong. Good thing our church is the true one
<br><br>
Today we played basketball with some people in the zone. Pretty fun, watching latinos play is always entertaining. Oh ya, the title. 2 funny dog (get it, ruff) moments this week
<br><br>
1) One less active member has a pit bull named Brawly. He is super old, but still a pit bull. We saw him attack another dog this week and full out bit him in the mouth. It was terrifying yet impressive. Not going to mess with him
<br><br>
2) There is a dog that lives at our house that always follows us. Laidlaw gave him the name Trundle. On Sunday, he followed us all the way to church and just waited outside the gate (he didnt wait 3 hours though). He also fought off a pack of 15 dogs by himself. He's the coolest dog ever.
<br><br>
So that's the week. Pretty crazy it's already 2015. We have consejo de lideres this week, so that should be fun. I love you guys a whole lot, and I'll talk to you next week.<br>
Elder Bagley
