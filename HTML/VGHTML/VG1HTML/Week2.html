            <h1>Week 2 <small>(December 29, 2014)</small></h1>
            <h3>Last letter of 2014</h3>
            <p><small>To whom it may concern,<br>
   That makes my letter sound really official. I just did it cause I feel like I put "Dear Family" every week, so I thought I`d switch it up. So I guess the biggest event of the week was... CHRISTMAS!!! It was great to be able to talk to you guys, even Griffin. It was like a little family reunion from 3 different countries. I assume I`ll still be here for mother`s day, so we should be able to coordinate the same thing in a few months. I would love to go day by day, but I honestly cant remember what happened on which day. I will just talk about the events of the week.
<br><br>
Christmas- Skype was the best part. For lunch we went with a bunch of elders to a food court. While we were there we saw a lady choking and one of the elders gave her the heimlich. It didnt work and the lady passed out. I honestly though she was going to die, but later some lady came back and told us she was ok. Maybe one day some missionaries will knock on the family`s door and they`ll remember how nice we were. Ya never know. The only other thing that happened on Christmas was that we taught Alfredo. He`s doing well in the lessons, but he has only come to church once because he is either traveling or sick. He`s one of our better investigators right now.
<br><br>
Finding new investigators- Boy is it hard sometimes. We are having to focus on that more because we dont have much going on. We`ve tried all different ways. We`ve knocked doors, looked for references, contacted in the street, looked for old investigators. We held umbrellas for people in the rain and helped them carry heavy things. It`s a tiring work. Then sometimes we find investigators that listen, but would never progress. We found this lady from a reference, and she was just weird. I almost laughed out loud from some of the things she said. However, we did have a little bit of success. Really, every single time I was about ready to fall down and die, we found someone new that seems good. One night we were walking at like 8:45 and we didnt have any options left. I was about ready to turn in for the day, when we saw this family and Elder Laidlaw contacted them. We have a lesson with them on Wednesday now, so hopefully it turns out well. Then yesterday, from like 2 to 4, we had nothing. We went to every house we know of an no one was home. Plus it was super hot and we have to walk uphill both ways. However, we knocked on one last door before falling over and dying, and we found a good new guy named Ariel. He was really interested in the plan of salvation. It really was a miracle to find him, and we have a lesson next saturday.
<br><br>
Crazy things- Being out in the field gives me the opportunity to see a lot more weird things. This week we had a drunk cholita (native lady) invite us to go to Potosi with her, we saw a guy standing in the middle of a field with no pants on, and just stuff like that. Bolivia is great.
<br><br>
People- Right now, we are just working on new investigators. However, we do have a less active family that are doing great and are just awesome people. It is the Flia Garcia, Richard and Gladys. The dad served in Quito Ecuador (shout out to dad) and is really spiritual during lessons. They just need an interview with the bishop and they are all set. And dad, just like you mentioned to me in your email how less actives are probably really excited to help the missionaries, its true. We have an FHE with them tonight and they are supposed to invite their friend. Other than them, the people are just travelling too much. We havent had appointments with a lot of investigators because they are all out of town.
<br><br>
Today- We played soccer as a zone and then went out to eat. The whole zone leader thing is a little tiring. Sometimes I feel like we watch over 24 kids, just cause we try to please everyone. It all turned out fine though, so we are all good.
<br><br>
So that`s the week. This week should be interesting. Wednesday we have exchanges with the APs, so I`m going to the richest area in the mission to work. Friday we should have interviews, which is also fun. Anyways, I love you guys so much, and I hope you have a great new year.<br>

                        <p>Christmas Eve #2. It was actually pretty good. In the morning we had a zone service activity. We went to an orphanage to give the kids candy and play with them. It turned out really well. I think everyone had a good time. The kids were super funny and it felt good to help out. After that we went to lunch, and then to work. We had a few things fall through, so that sucks. We talked to Jheri and Veronica and that was good. We helped them set up their Christmas stuff and then talked about service in the church. After dinner we talked to Richard and Gladys. We talked about the temple and it was a great lesson. Richard always thinks and meditates a lot, and he really listens to the spirit. They're an awesome family. They gave us some food at the end and that capped off our Christmas Eve. An enjoyable one.</p>

                        <p>Woohoo!!! Christmas #2! So we woke up all normal, got ready, and opened presents. There was a bunch of good stuff, and I even got stuff from Laidlaw's family. After that we did personal study, and then we watched a Christ movie for comp study. For language study we learned Christmas words. After that we picked up some stuff from a member and then talked to some less actives about Christmas. For lunch we met up with a bunch of elders and ate at a food court. While we were there some lady passed out from choking. We tried to help, but they ended up rushing her to a hospital. Luckily she was ok. After lunch we went to the bishop's giant house and called our families. It was great and we even did a 3 way call between me, them, and Griffin in Ecuador. I really miss them, but everyone's doing well. Griff's a great missionary. Finally to end the day we had a lesson with Alfredo. It went pretty well and he's progressing. Hopefully he can keep it up. Anyways, good Christmas, I'm sad it's over.</p>

                      <p>Today was a bit tough. In the morning we headed out to Sacaba. Since one of the areas closed, we had to take the stuff out of the house. The house is on the 6th floor of a building without an elevator. It was a tough job, but we got it done in like 2 1/2 hours. After loading, we had to go to Nacho's house to drop it off. After that, and lunch, we got to work. Actually, we had to wait for it to stop hailing, and then we got to work. We went out with Ivan for the whole afternoon. We had NOTHING. Like every appt and back up plan fell through. Finally we knocked on a door and got a lesson with this lady named Carmen. After that we taught Crusesa (kinda a lame lesson). Really, the only good part of the night was when we randomly contacted a family in the street. They seemed pretty cool, so hopefully it works out. We really need to get something going.<br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <p>A somewhat decent day. We went in the morning to have a service project, but it fell through. After that we just went home. We did a weekly planning session, probably the first real one I've done in 7 months. After that and lunch, we had a few lessons. First, we taught a lady named Gregoria. She was interesting. She loved to talk, didn't understand super well, and I honestly almost laughed a few times... After that we taught a recent convert named Isabel. We walked around for a little after that, and some appts fell through. It started raining, and we tried to offer people an umbrella, but that didn't work either. We had a lesson with a less active named Nina, and then we finished the day with English classes. We've done a little better at contacting in the streets, so hopefully that pays off soon.</p>

                    <p>Finally, this should be my last Sunday ever having church at 8am. Anyways, today was interesting. We got to church all normal and stuff, but when we got all settled we found out Jherry wasn't coming cause he and Veronica got in a fight. Luckily, the Flia Rivero was there to help them and solve problems. It's really important that they have that support from members. After lunch, we tried to decide whether to visit them or not. We decided against it, and for the following 100min, we had nothing. We walked all over and the only things that happened was that we had a drunk cholita invite us to Potosi and we saw a guy walking around without pants. Finally we knocked a door (I was about ready to be done) and a guy named Ariel opened, let us in, and we taught all of lesson 2. Miracles. After that we talked to Richard and Gladys, who are becoming my favorite people. We talked about some stuff, got a few references, and set up an FHE for tomorrow. The day started poorly, but it ended well. Finding success will take time, but it will happen.</p>

                    <p>P-day!!! Today was pretty good. We went to play soccer in the morning with the zone. It was good. We played gringos vs. latinos, and we ended up in a tie. After that we went to the center to Eli's to eat pizza. Sometimes the whole zone leader thing feels like being a parent. It's like having like 24 kids. I just want them to be happy and that's good enough for me. After that we did internet and went to IC Norte. There we met a family from California (Bolivian) that gave us 100bs and wouldn't take no for an answer. At night we met up at Richard's for an FHE, but before that we helped him with his car. I felt super sick and I ended up using some random guy's bathroom. We did have a good FHE with them. They're a special family, and I'm sure they'll help us with missionary work. The week starts again tomorrow, should be good though.</p>
