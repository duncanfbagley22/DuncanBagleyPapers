            <h1>Week 6 <small>(January 26, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>Animal Planet's Most Extreme</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
     This was a somewhat difficult week. Not too bad, but a little tough. We had a whole lot of things fall through. Worst part is that we have changes. Elder Laidlaw is leaving to go to Potosi to die (meaning, to end his mission). I'm really bummed that he's leaving. Luckily, I get a good companion to replace him. I am going to be with Elder Hansen from Washington. I lived with him for a cambio in the offices (he's the other white guy, the one that isnt E Davis). We should get some good work done, but I'm still going to miss elder Laidlaw. Really, it isnt that bad. Honestly, I'm kinda excited. More anxious actually. We have a lot of good missionaries coming into the zone, so it'll be fun. I'm going to have to show Elder Hansen the area and show him Zone Leader stuff, so I'll get a lot more responsability on my shoulders. It'll be good. 
<br><br>
Honestly, I cant really go day by day for this week, cause I dont really remember what happened each day. There are a few things I remember though. 
<br><br>
Investigators- We're still working hard to get things going. We finally got someone to come to church. There's this elderly lady named Nora. She's really nice, and wants to know more about God, so luckily we showed up. She came to church yesterday and seemed to enjoy it. The other investigators are not going for various reasons. Our best investigator, Marlon, still hasnt gone for a while. He is a dentist, so last week he went to Potosi to get meds. Yesterday he was in Oruro cause his mom was sick or something. He reads and has a testimony and everything, we just cant get him to church. We've found some good people in recent days, but it's a long process to get people to church and baptized. We had an FHE with the pensionista's family and an investigator named Lilian. She's got a lot of potential. Really, we've got things to work with, but no big success as of yet.
<br><br>
Members- We were having some problems with some of the recent converts here, just fighting and stuff. Luckily, things are getting better. They are the coolest family, with really big testimonies. One of their good friends got baptized on Saturday (in the other Elders` area) and when they went it seems like they remembered their baptisms and helped smooth things out. The ward as a whole is really helpful, so it is nice. The WML is great. Their family just loves the missionaries and helps out a ton. One sad thing is that I could possibly leave this next change. Elder Hansen finishes in April, so its either I'll leave in March, or I'll finish here.
<br><br>
Administrative stuff- We had to do cleaning checks this week, all around the zone. Our zone is really big, so it was a time consuming activity. Also, we had to go to the center to pick up BoMs and pamphlets and stuff. Me, Laidlaw, and Hansen (who was in charge of that stuff) road in the back of a truck on the freeway there (sorry mom). We also had to give a baptismal interview and stuff like that.
<br><br>
*I'm just realizing how unorganized this email is, sorry* 
<br><br>
So all in all, I really dont have many interesting things to say. We've been knocking doors and talking to a bunch of people, just trying to find the prepared people. They're there, so we just need to find them. This week should be interesting. One day I'm doing an intercambio with an elder from the zone, the other I'm going to probably just be with members, then the third I'm going to be in the office. Elder Hansen has to train his replacement, so he cant come till Thursday. I also have a monthly meeting with President Hansen and the stake president, zone meeting, and just... it's going to be a party. I hope all is well at home, love you, talk to you next week.
<br><br>
Elder Bagley
<br><br><br><br>

p.s We had a lot of cool animal moments this week. We saw a dog just off a roof, we saw a dog get kicked off a giant wall, and we saw a bouncing lamb (basically the same as that Bound, and Rebound pixar short thing. Last night we caught a firefly too. Great week for animals
<br><br>
p.p.s Probably the coolest thing. I was talking to Rosella, my convert from El Paso, who is sending her papers in soon, and planning on going through the temple in April when she hits a year as a member. That's gotta be the coolest thing I could hear

                        <p>Tuesdays are always slow days. Not like they take a long time, but they're not very exciting work wise. In the morning we had district meeting and stuff. It was good. The zone has gotten a lot more enjoyable since the first week. After the meetings we went to lunch, and then out to work. We only got one lesson in. We talked to Marlon for a bit and left him some homework. We left a note and wrote "perscription" on top. He's a dentist, so we thought we were clever. After that we went to the office to do all that fun stuff. I always like going, just cause I miss Davis and Vega. At night we just ate dinner like normal and then we went to the chapel because people were playing soccer, and we invited an investigator. He didn't go though. Tomorrow should be a little more normal I hope.</p>

                        <p>I'd love to say that today was awesome, but I'd be lying. It was bad because I'm sick. It's just a cold, but it's annoying. That being said, in the morning we went and did cleaning checks for a few areas. Kind of tedious, but cool to see where everyone lives. After those, we went and got me some medicine, and then out to work. We had a lesson in the morning with Kevin. We decided to drop him unless he goes to church on Sunday. I think it went well though. After that, and lunch, we talked to this less active kid named Alejandro. Kind of an odd dude, but nice. For a while after that, everything fell through. That, plus being sick, wasn't fun. We worked though, and tried to be happy doing it. Fun things of the day: we found out our dog "Trundle" is actually named "Max". Also, we saw him jump off a 2nd story roof and come out ok. We ended the night talking to Veronica. We needed a member, and we luckily got Kevin to go with us. Even though today wasn't great, I still kinda enjoyed it.</p>

                        <p>Today is the day of "Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia". Basically, a made up, worthless holiday. Bolivians are big into holidays. Today wasn't super great. In the morning we went to do a service project at the pensionista's house. We moved buckets and buckets of dirt, but it wasn't too bad. I'm always fine with helping the pensionista, she deserves it. After that the afternoon... kind of a tough afternoon. All of our plans fell through, so that was a bad start. We did a little bit of door knocking. We did find one guy named Gaston. Nice guy, curious about the BoM. We also talked to this lady Nora. She's nice and she's pretty open. We ended the day at the Flia Rivero's house. Hno Rivero is one of the coolest people ever, and a great WML. So ya, most of the day wasn't great, but oh well, we continue on.</p>

                      <p>Today was pretty good actually. In the morning we went to Sacaba and Esmerablda and we did cleaning checks. Not the most exciting thing. After that we had a lesson with Lilian. She's doing well, and I think she's starting to recognize the spirit, so we just need more of that. After lunch we talked to Julio Cesar. He's gonna be a solid investigator. After him we talked to Marlon. Hoenstly, the only thing he needs is to go to church. He reads and stuff, but no church. At night we had to split up. Laidlaw stayed at the church and did a baptismal interview while I went and taught Richard and Gladys. Everything is great with the and they're just great. We found out Jhery is having problems right now, so that'll be our main focus tomorrow.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <h3>January 24, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Interesting day. In the morning we went to the Arocagua chapel to take material, then to the Cobija Stake Center to get stuff (we rode in the back of a trcuk). After that adventure, we had a lesson with a kid named Wilson. He read a bunch in the BoM which was good. He's still got a ways to go, but it's a start. We then planned for a bit, ate lunch, and then went to the chapel to help fill up the font for a baptism. Then we went all the way up hill to talk to Nora. She's pretty good, we just have to teach things in little parts so she understands. Then we went to a baptism that the other elders had. A guy named Mauricio. Super cool guy. Luckily, Jhery and Veronica went. We've been a little worried about them recently, but they seemed really good today. Best part of the day was when we saw a lamb do a heelclick (you had to be there). So ya, interesting day.</p>

                    <p>Ch ch ch ch ch ch changes. So ya, we have changes. Laidlaw is leaving to Cerro Rico in Potosi. Earlier this week we were talking about which would be the worst area. We said Cerro Rico. He'll do great, and he's not too worried. I'm going to be with Elder Hansen. We lived together in the offices for 6 weeks, so I know him pretty well. We got a few solid people coming in, so I'm excited. As far as what happened today... We did get someone to go to church. Nora came and she seemed to enjoy it. Finally got one there. In the afternoon, everything fell through. 3 appts in a row. We knocked a few doors, and it actually went ok. We also talked to Ivan. We talked about learning in church and stuff. I'm gonna miss Laidlaw a bunch. I'm excited to be with Hansen, but Laidlaw was one of my favorite comps. Oh well, that's the mission.</p>

                    <h3>January 26, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Last p-day of the cambio. I spent the morning sewing my pants, or at least attempting. After that we headed down and did internet. For the rest of the day we just hung out with Elder Skousen and Elder Valerio. We're all planning on living together, so we just decided to hang out as "Super 4". We just ate a little bit at Fridays and walked around and stuff. Even though we didn't really do anything, it was fun. Living together is going to be fun. In the early afternoon, we had to go deal with some dude that wanted us to take his garbage. After that we went and talked to Jhery and Veronica, then we went to see Richard and Gladys, and then we went down to the Flia Rivero's house. We had a nice FHE with them, the other missionaries, Jhery's family, and some other people. It was rought to see Laidlaw say goodbye, but it always happens. That's the mission.</p>
