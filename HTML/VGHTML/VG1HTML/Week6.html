            <h1>Week 6 <small>(January 26, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>Animal Planet's Most Extreme</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
     This was a somewhat difficult week. Not too bad, but a little tough. We had a whole lot of things fall through. Worst part is that we have changes. Elder Laidlaw is leaving to go to Potosi to die (meaning, to end his mission). I'm really bummed that he's leaving. Luckily, I get a good companion to replace him. I am going to be with Elder Hansen from Washington. I lived with him for a cambio in the offices (he's the other white guy, the one that isnt E Davis). We should get some good work done, but I'm still going to miss elder Laidlaw. Really, it isnt that bad. Honestly, I'm kinda excited. More anxious actually. We have a lot of good missionaries coming into the zone, so it'll be fun. I'm going to have to show Elder Hansen the area and show him Zone Leader stuff, so I'll get a lot more responsability on my shoulders. It'll be good. 
<br><br>
Honestly, I cant really go day by day for this week, cause I dont really remember what happened each day. There are a few things I remember though. 
<br><br>
Investigators- We're still working hard to get things going. We finally got someone to come to church. There's this elderly lady named Nora. She's really nice, and wants to know more about God, so luckily we showed up. She came to church yesterday and seemed to enjoy it. The other investigators are not going for various reasons. Our best investigator, Marlon, still hasnt gone for a while. He is a dentist, so last week he went to Potosi to get meds. Yesterday he was in Oruro cause his mom was sick or something. He reads and has a testimony and everything, we just cant get him to church. We've found some good people in recent days, but it's a long process to get people to church and baptized. We had an FHE with the pensionista's family and an investigator named Lilian. She's got a lot of potential. Really, we've got things to work with, but no big success as of yet.
<br><br>
Members- We were having some problems with some of the recent converts here, just fighting and stuff. Luckily, things are getting better. They are the coolest family, with really big testimonies. One of their good friends got baptized on Saturday (in the other Elders` area) and when they went it seems like they remembered their baptisms and helped smooth things out. The ward as a whole is really helpful, so it is nice. The WML is great. Their family just loves the missionaries and helps out a ton. One sad thing is that I could possibly leave this next change. Elder Hansen finishes in April, so its either I'll leave in March, or I'll finish here.
<br><br>
Administrative stuff- We had to do cleaning checks this week, all around the zone. Our zone is really big, so it was a time consuming activity. Also, we had to go to the center to pick up BoMs and pamphlets and stuff. Me, Laidlaw, and Hansen (who was in charge of that stuff) road in the back of a truck on the freeway there (sorry mom). We also had to give a baptismal interview and stuff like that.
<br><br>
*I'm just realizing how unorganized this email is, sorry* 
<br><br>
So all in all, I really dont have many interesting things to say. We've been knocking doors and talking to a bunch of people, just trying to find the prepared people. They're there, so we just need to find them. This week should be interesting. One day I'm doing an intercambio with an elder from the zone, the other I'm going to probably just be with members, then the third I'm going to be in the office. Elder Hansen has to train his replacement, so he cant come till Thursday. I also have a monthly meeting with President Hansen and the stake president, zone meeting, and just... it's going to be a party. I hope all is well at home, love you, talk to you next week.
<br><br>
Elder Bagley
<br><br><br><br>

p.s We had a lot of cool animal moments this week. We saw a dog just off a roof, we saw a dog get kicked off a giant wall, and we saw a bouncing lamb (basically the same as that Bound, and Rebound pixar short thing. Last night we caught a firefly too. Great week for animals
<br><br>
p.p.s Probably the coolest thing. I was talking to Rosella, my convert from El Paso, who is sending her papers in soon, and planning on going through the temple in April when she hits a year as a member. That's gotta be the coolest thing I could hear
