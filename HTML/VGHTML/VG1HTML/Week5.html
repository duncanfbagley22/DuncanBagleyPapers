            <h1>Week 5 <small>(January 19, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>One Hundo</h3>
            <p><small>Hello again family,<br>
   Honestly, this was a really good week. The title explains the best part of the week. Now, let's keep in mind that the numbers in a mission dont really matter, the people matter. However, the numbers can be a display of how the missionaries are working. I know that in every mission it's different as well. Basically, I just dont want to sound prideful. Anyways, on tuesday we set a goal with our zone. We decided that as a zone we were going to try to get 100 lessons taught to an investigator with a member present. It's the best way to teach a lesson, as it helps the investigator and the member. Our zone has 26 people, so we needed something like 7.7 lessons per companionship . Our zone was averaging like 4 and the mission averages like 3.5. It's an average that companionships get by themselves once in a while, but as a zone it is difficult. Well, we set it and followed it every few days. We ended up with 114 lessons at the end of the week. Probably doesnt mean much to people at home, but to us it was awesome. The APs were super excited when we told them. Me and Laidlaw now call ourselves Zona 100 and we are just super happy that we reached the goal. That aside, this is what happened this week.
<br><br>
Monday- We just had a low key day. At night we had an FHE with Marlon, probably our best investigator. Our EQ president and his wife came too. It was great. Marlon is super awesome. Problem is that his pregnant less active girlfriend gets sick a lot and just always gets sick Sunday morning. Really frustrating. Other than going to church, he's great.
<br><br>
Tuesday- Just a regular day. Our appts fell through, we went to the office, etc. At night we taught a less active lady named Maria. She is like a regular bolivian person here (criticizes everyone but never takes responsability)
<br><br>
Wednesday- In the morning we went to our pensionistas house and helped build a table. We built it with her husband. He is one of my favorite people here and reminds me a lot of grandpa. In the afternoon we had a few lessons with some less actives and recent converts. Richard and Gladys are our less actives that are almost active and probably my favorite family here. We taught them and then Jhery and Veronica, a family that are converts of Laidlaw. Probably my other favorite family. It also rained super hard that day, so hard that it turned to hail. 
<br><br>
Thursday- First we taught this lady named Viviana. She is really nice and seems interested, we just havent found out whats stopping her progress. We also taught this less active family. They are a little crazy and we think that the daughter has a weird crush on Laidlaw, cause it's just always super awkward with them. We are trying to get her active though, and it is slowly working. We had ward counsel at night, but hardly anyone came because it was raining really hard.
<br><br>
Friday- A good day. We talked to Marlon and then Viviana, as well as Richard and Gladys. We met this new lady named Lilian, who lives next to the pension. She seems really good, and we have an FHE with her and the pensionista's family tonight. We worked really hard and got a bunch of members to come with us all day.
<br><br>
Saturday- Not a super productive day. We found this old investigator that says that she is really confused about churchs, perfect thing for the gospel to fix. We talked to her as well as a recent convert named Kevin. He is a super awesome kid and wants to go on a mission, but his dad doesnt support him. We helped explain how he can go with the Lord's help. He started off slow as a convert, but he is super converted now. It's awesome. 
<br><br>
Sunday- Probably the best day. First, we got to church and I saw a less active lady from Ingavi. We visited them a bunch while I was in that ward, but she was super against going back to church. However, she is dating a member of Villa Graciela, so she is getting active again. She has a testimony, she just got offended by members. In the afternoon we worked hard. We found 2 new guys that seem really good. One is confused about churchs, the other is confused about God. We had 2 really good lessons with them. As we worked harder to get our share of the zone's goal, we really saw the Lord bless us. The only bad part was that while we were talking to someone at a door, their dog came out and peed on my leg. Just a demoralizing thing. 
<br><br>
We really saw some big miracles from setting our goal. People that usually average 1 or 2 lessons with a member per week got like 8 or 9. It was great. We decided that as a reward for going above and beyond the goal that we would go to Pairumani as a zone. It's this wilderness park thingy up in the mountains. We went today and it was really fun. 
<br><br>
So ya, good week. We are really seeing the success starting to come in our area and the zone. This sunday is changes, but hopefully we both stay. I love you guys a lot and I'll talk to you next week.<br>
