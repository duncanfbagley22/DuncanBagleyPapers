            <h1>Week 5 <small>(January 19, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>One Hundo</h3>
            <p><small>Hello again family,<br>
   Honestly, this was a really good week. The title explains the best part of the week. Now, let's keep in mind that the numbers in a mission dont really matter, the people matter. However, the numbers can be a display of how the missionaries are working. I know that in every mission it's different as well. Basically, I just dont want to sound prideful. Anyways, on tuesday we set a goal with our zone. We decided that as a zone we were going to try to get 100 lessons taught to an investigator with a member present. It's the best way to teach a lesson, as it helps the investigator and the member. Our zone has 26 people, so we needed something like 7.7 lessons per companionship . Our zone was averaging like 4 and the mission averages like 3.5. It's an average that companionships get by themselves once in a while, but as a zone it is difficult. Well, we set it and followed it every few days. We ended up with 114 lessons at the end of the week. Probably doesnt mean much to people at home, but to us it was awesome. The APs were super excited when we told them. Me and Laidlaw now call ourselves Zona 100 and we are just super happy that we reached the goal. That aside, this is what happened this week.
<br><br>
Monday- We just had a low key day. At night we had an FHE with Marlon, probably our best investigator. Our EQ president and his wife came too. It was great. Marlon is super awesome. Problem is that his pregnant less active girlfriend gets sick a lot and just always gets sick Sunday morning. Really frustrating. Other than going to church, he's great.
<br><br>
Tuesday- Just a regular day. Our appts fell through, we went to the office, etc. At night we taught a less active lady named Maria. She is like a regular bolivian person here (criticizes everyone but never takes responsability)
<br><br>
Wednesday- In the morning we went to our pensionistas house and helped build a table. We built it with her husband. He is one of my favorite people here and reminds me a lot of grandpa. In the afternoon we had a few lessons with some less actives and recent converts. Richard and Gladys are our less actives that are almost active and probably my favorite family here. We taught them and then Jhery and Veronica, a family that are converts of Laidlaw. Probably my other favorite family. It also rained super hard that day, so hard that it turned to hail. 
<br><br>
Thursday- First we taught this lady named Viviana. She is really nice and seems interested, we just havent found out whats stopping her progress. We also taught this less active family. They are a little crazy and we think that the daughter has a weird crush on Laidlaw, cause it's just always super awkward with them. We are trying to get her active though, and it is slowly working. We had ward counsel at night, but hardly anyone came because it was raining really hard.
<br><br>
Friday- A good day. We talked to Marlon and then Viviana, as well as Richard and Gladys. We met this new lady named Lilian, who lives next to the pension. She seems really good, and we have an FHE with her and the pensionista's family tonight. We worked really hard and got a bunch of members to come with us all day.
<br><br>
Saturday- Not a super productive day. We found this old investigator that says that she is really confused about churchs, perfect thing for the gospel to fix. We talked to her as well as a recent convert named Kevin. He is a super awesome kid and wants to go on a mission, but his dad doesnt support him. We helped explain how he can go with the Lord's help. He started off slow as a convert, but he is super converted now. It's awesome. 
<br><br>
Sunday- Probably the best day. First, we got to church and I saw a less active lady from Ingavi. We visited them a bunch while I was in that ward, but she was super against going back to church. However, she is dating a member of Villa Graciela, so she is getting active again. She has a testimony, she just got offended by members. In the afternoon we worked hard. We found 2 new guys that seem really good. One is confused about churchs, the other is confused about God. We had 2 really good lessons with them. As we worked harder to get our share of the zone's goal, we really saw the Lord bless us. The only bad part was that while we were talking to someone at a door, their dog came out and peed on my leg. Just a demoralizing thing. 
<br><br>
We really saw some big miracles from setting our goal. People that usually average 1 or 2 lessons with a member per week got like 8 or 9. It was great. We decided that as a reward for going above and beyond the goal that we would go to Pairumani as a zone. It's this wilderness park thingy up in the mountains. We went today and it was really fun. 
<br><br>
So ya, good week. We are really seeing the success starting to come in our area and the zone. This sunday is changes, but hopefully we both stay. I love you guys a lot and I'll talk to you next week.<br>

                        <p>I realized that most of the time I say that the day was boring or lame or whatever. Today I'm going to say that it was wonderful. We had lots of things fall through, but just being a missionary is great. We had district meeting in the morning. The zone meeting part was tough. We tried to get a p-day planned, and it's just tough. Missionaries are like children sometimes. After lunch, we went out with Ivan, but our appts fell through. We then went to the offices to do financiero. I just like going cause I get to see Vega and Davis. After the office trip, we talked to a less active named Maria. She's actually kinda good, we could get her reactivated. Honestly, it was a rough day. I've decided to just take every day as a learning opportunity. I've realized that we can learn a lot, just that we have to look to learn.</p>

                        <p>Another wonderful day of being a missionary. In the morning, we went out to Sacaba to negotiate a house, but when we got there, the guy wasn't even there. Bolivians. After that we went over to the Quiroga family's house where we helped build a table. Actually, one of the cooler service projects. After lunch, we went to pick up Jhony. He used to not like the missionaries, but recently he started liking us again. He came with us all day. First, we talked to this lady named Julia. She showed a little bit of potential, so hopefully it works out. Then we visited Richard and Gladys. We talked and while we were there it started raining <u>super</u> hard. Luckily we were inside. We ended the day talking to Jhery and Veronica. They are an awesome family who are really converted. It's great. Long day, but not too bad.</p>

                        <p>Boy, did it rain today. All day long, and didn't stop. That makes missionary work fun. We just had planning and stuff in the morning, so it was pretty boring. In the afternoon we had Ivan with us. He's great and always is willing to help us. First, we visited Viviana. She showed some signs of promise, moreso this lesson than the last one. We'll see what happens. After that me and Laidlaw both felt a little sick, so we had to stop at a few bathrooms along the way. After we got feeling better, we taught the Flia Arce. We talked about the Restoration and just went over some stuff. We had consejo de barrio, but no one really came because it was raining. Oh well, I'm happy. Tomorrow should be good.</p>

                      <p>Well gosh darn it, we worked hard today. We have a goal with the zone to get 100 lessons with a member. We can't set the goal though if we don't help, so we're really hoping to get some. In the morning we had a good one. We taught a lady named Lillian. She understands well, and is interested, so we'll see how it goes. We had a member, Jose Carlos, with us all morning. In the afternoon, we took Ever Garcia with us. With him we first taught Marlon. We talked about the Obra Misional, and I think it was a really good lesson. Hopefully he can just come to church. His girlfriend Jhanet always gets sick, so that's the hard part. We had another lesson with Viviana. She's doing ok, just waiting to see if she'll go to church. We ended the day with Richard and Gladys. We talked about chastity, had an awkward moment with Richard's dad as he told us we shouldn't talk about chastity, but it all turned out ok. Hopefully tomorrow goes well too.</p>

                    <p>While today might not be a super numbers day, I felt like it was good. In the morning we went with Jhony and found this new lady named Elsa. She's pretty good, she talked to missionaries before. She says she's confused about church, and we have the answer. We had 2 dogs follow us there, and were annoying the whole lesson. From there we taught Kevin. We kinda gave him an ultimatum, hopefully he pulls through. After the lesson, we helped these ladies move some cement bags, and we contacted them. We have an appt tomorrow. We were supposed to have members with us, but the 8 options we have all couldn't. We ended up talking to Kevin, a recent convert. He's great. He wants to go on a mission, and after a slow start, he's really converted. We did contact the lady named Jhovana, who seems really good. We had english classes to end the day. I really don't like english classes. Oh well. The zone is fairly close to getting our goal, so hopefully we get it.</p>

                    <p>Today turned out well. No one went to church, so that blows. However, I did see Bridget there. She's a less active from Ingavi, like super inactive. She's dating a member now, though, so she's reactivating. After church, we went out to work with Alvaro. We had every single appt and back up plan fall through, but that didn't stop us. We met the nicest old lady ever, Irene. She might not progress, but she was so nice that it made me feel warm inside. After her, we met this kid named Julio Cesar. Actually really interested, has good questions and really seems like he can progress. On the way to our last appointment, we saw Richard and Gladys. They didn't go to church, but it's because they got invited to lunch by Gladys‚Äôs family, which is a miracle. They used to hate Richard, but with the new baby and stuff they've warmed up. Blessings of the gospel. To end the night we met a kid named Wilson. Isn't sure he believes in God, but he's receptive. I can see him progressing. During the lesson, a dog peed on me, so that sucks. We had a really successful day today.</p>

                    <p>P-day! So, as a zone we reach 114 lessons with a member, which is pretty darn awesome! Because of that we went as a zone to Pairumani today. me and Laidlaw went early to buy the food and stuff, and after that we headed out. It turned out a lot better than I expected. We had the majority of the zone, it took less travel time than expected, and everyone seemed to enjoy it. Me, Laidlaw, elder Hansen and elder Prescott made a hilarious parkour video (which includes Prescott face planting into a trash can). On the way out it got a little stressful, but it turned out ok. To end p-day we had internet. We went to the Flia Garcia‚Äôs internet, where they gave us food and didn‚Äôt have to pay. Also found out that Rosella, my convert from El Paso, started mission papers. Awesome. At night we had an FHE with the Flia Quiroga and Lilian (our investigator) and her family. Good FHE, the Hna Quiroga talks a little too much, but it was still good. We played a game with the kids, so I think that helped. Overall, a super solid day.</p>
