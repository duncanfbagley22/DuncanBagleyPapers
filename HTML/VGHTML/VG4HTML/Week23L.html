Dear President Hansen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a great week. I really cant express how amazing it is to see all the blessings and miracles happen this last transfer. Everything is going perfectly. This last transfer has been the best one of my whole mission. One cool experience from this week was being able to go to the temple with the Flia Garcia. They were less active for a few years, and I've been working with them for 5 months. On Friday everything was finally ready for them to go to the temple to do a session. Just getting there was a miracle. First we couldnt find a babysitter for the kids, but at the last minute someone changed their mind and decided to help them. Then, we got there and literally ran out of gas at the door of the temple. Just enough to get us where we needed to go. Being in the temple was a really special experience. Really, I dont know if there is anything that could make me happier. We also have 2 investigators that preparing for baptism this week. They've progressed so well over the last transfer. I've really seen how the Lord is in control of everything during this transfer. Elder Hansen and I were just sowing, and now Elder Bradford and I are reaping. Everything we do just turns out well. This week, we hiked up to a pueblo in our area and talked to like 3 people. The 3rd guy we met let us in and we had a great lesson. He even came to church yesterday. It's like 30 minutes away to walk, so it was awesome to see him there. As my mission comes to an end this week, and really cant find words to express how much it has changed my life. I've learned who God is, who I am, and that He loves me. This is His church and I am so grateful that I was fortunate enough to receive this call that has changed my life. I'm truly converted because of these 2 years. Bolivia is a very special place, and I know that it was exactly where I needed to be. Thank you for the influence you've had on my life this last year. I really dont have words to describe how I feel right now, but I love this work, I love this church, and I love my Savior. Thank you for EVERYTHING
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Bagley

I felt a subtle whispering of the Spirit when I felt impressed to ask you to serve as a ZL in Sacaba. During the first couple of transfers when you were working so hard with little success I started to doubt whether I had actually followed the Spirit in asking you to serve there. I so badly wanted you to really have a special experience in your last area. It is so reassuring now to see you reaping so many blessings from your hard work over a long period of time, and I now have no doubt that the Lord wanted you exactly where you are as you end your mission. Well done, Elder Bagley. The Lord loves you and is rewarding you for your two years of faithful service.
