                        <p>Today wasn't super fun, but it was ok. We started with our district and zone meetings. Weird that it's my last one. I gave my last testimony and stuff. Just weird. This was my hardest zone, so I'm kind of glad to be done with it. However, we've seen a few people really progress a lot, so it was all worth it. Afterwards, we took pictures and stuff, I said bye to some people, and then we went home. After lunch we went down to teach Amanda and Leslie. Actually, just Amanda, because Leslie had some emergency to deal with. Amanda's doing well though, she's ready for baptism. It's a pretty cool how we met them. God works in mysterious ways. After all that, we didn't really find much to do. Just some appointments that we took out. Just 2 more days... weird.</p>

                        <p>Today was good. 2nd to last day of work. We needed to keep daily contact with Amanda and Leslie, so we went by in the morning. They're still doing well, everything should be good for Saturday. After that we went home to finish our studies. After lunch we went way up to go teach a lady named Gladys Flores. She wasn't there, but we did find her son, Alex. We taught him the first lesson. He's good enough, hope he progresses. From there we went to the offices. I spent most the time downloading all my pictures that I had left on the office computer. It took a while, so we spent a good chunk of time there. To end the day, we went and taught the Flia Garcia. They're awesome. We just talked about the temple and how they're doing. That's all. 1 more day.</p>

                        <p>Last day of work. Weird stuff. The morning was normal. Studies and then weekly planning. Actually, we just updated the area book. From there we went to lunch and then down to the other area to pick up our clothes. In the afternoon we talked to Amanda and Leslie. It seems like everything is ready to go for Saturday. I'm a little nervous for the baptism, but that's normal for me. After that we taught Jhonny. He's incredible. We talked about tithing and he already wants to pay to get blessings. He's just a miracle. The most prepared person I've met. To end the night we talked to Jhery and Veronica. It was a really spiritual, as we talked about the atonement. It was a great way to end the day. Also, as my last lesson, it was great. Crazy that I'm done "working". Teaching will be something I'll miss a lot.</p>

                      <p>Today was long. In the morning I woke up (probably got like 4 hours of sleep, because of packing and stuff) and we went to the going-home training meeting. 8 hours of boredom. It wasn't that the instructor was bad, just the subject matter. It was about job interviews and school and stuff. More for latinos than for us. Very relieved when it ended. About an hour after that I had my final interview with Pres Hansen. It was solid. We just talked about what to do at home and how to not become a bad RM. Keep an active recommend always, get good study habits, look for a wife, etc. Good advice. For dinner, we went to Friday's as a group (me, Toomer, Valerio, Christensen, Harwood, and Johnston). Solid group of guys that've become some of my really good friends. To end the night we went and visited E' Christensen's pensionista in Villa Moscu. Like I said, long day.</p>

                    <p>Great day. First great thing was going to the temple with the group. This one was spiritual, especially once we got to the celestial room. I read Alma 26 and just thought about what we've all been through in the last 2 years. From there, we went to the baptism. Amanda, Leslie, and Milenka (someone the other elders taught) all got baptized. I baptized Leslie, first time baptizing in more than a year. It was a good service, and the ward did a great job in supporting them. Pretty incredible how God blessed me with 2 baptisms at the end. So if that wasn't good enough, we then went to El Paso and ate with Benita (still amazing food). We also visited Rosella, who's very active. After making the long trip back to the city, we first went to visit Christensen's pension in America and then to visit Andres. He's great to be with. He has a testimony and stuff, but just needs support. I'm gonna miss him a ton. 1 temple trip, 2 baptisms, 2 visits to my converts, and eating with Benita. Great day.</p>

                    <p>Last sunday. We left early and went to Barrio Jardin. The ward's a little weaker than before, but there're still a few people that remembered me. One guy told me that I helped him get his brother on a mission. Who knew? We then ran over to Villa Graciela to go to church. Best ward ever. (New Pen) I had to give a talk, so I just made my testimony a little longer. We had a bunch of investigators at church (even Jesus came), Jhonny too. Amanda and Leslie also got confirmed. I'm gonna miss this ward a lot, it's like a home ward. We ate lunch with the Flia Valle, and then we visited Amanda and Leslie. Both great places to go. From there we went by Villa Moscu to visit some of Christensen's people. We ended with 3 visits in Villa Graciela. First we visited the Flia Quiroga. That's the only place I cried. They're like family, and I'll miss them a ton. Second we visited the Flia Garcia. Great people, and one of the coolest experiences of my mission was with them. To end things we visited Jhery and Veronica. Jhery's been doing a lot better recently. So ya, tomorrow's the big day.</p>

                    <p>I never thought this day would come. 2 years talking about it and I'm finally done. Today was a good day though. In the morning we printed pictures and stuff. We also went out to eat with the bishop. Greatest bishop I've worked with, awesome guy and super dedicated to helping the ward. We went to Luigi's to say bye to missionaries. In the afternoon we had lunch in the mission home and a short meeting. I was a little disappointed, cause my pictures didn't show up in the presentation, but it's no big deal. It was sad to say bye to the Hansens. They're great. They both told me they love me and I said the same. We contacted the taxi driver on the way to the airport, and then at the airport we got ready to go. It's a surreal thing, seems like a dream. The person I'll miss most is Elder Vega, one of my best friends, but not sure I'll see him again. The flight to Santa Cruz was short, but the layover is long. 2nd flight doesn't leave until 2am. We're here with Tapia and Cossio, people that served in our mission just killing time. Tomorrow will be a long day.</p>

                    <p>Well, it's not the end of the day yet, but considering that I will be dead tired tonight and not a missionary anymore, I might as well do it now. Right now we've got like 90min - 2hrs until we get off. Today's been a little long. We left Santa Cruz at 2, got to Panama at 6, left there at 8 and got to Atlanta at like 12 or 1. Now we're on our way to SLC. I keep feeling nervous, but excited. In Atlanta we had a good time. We went to Chic-fil-a (don't know how to spell it) for lunch, which was great. We've also met a ton of members here. The church is true for everyone. Also, currently on our flight is Elder Russell M Nelson of the Quorum of the 12 apostles. We got to shake his hand and meet him. Awesome blessing to be able to meet an apostle, especially as a missionary. He's just got something special about him, but he's just a regular person at the -><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

These have been the best 2 years of my life so far. They've changed me completely. I owe everything I am to the mission and what the Lord has given me during this time. Especially during these last 6 weeks, I've seen miracles. We rescued a family and went to the temple with them. I was praying to have a baptism, hopefully a family, and my last Saturday we baptized a mother and her daughter. We met Jhonny, the most prepared person I've met, just through a street contact. So many things I've always been waiting to see, finally happen. God just waited until the time was right. I'm so grateful for this opportunity. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, but the</p>

                    <p>most rewarding. I wouldn't trade this experience for anything. It's blessed me, it's blessed my family, and it's blessed the people of Bolivia. I know this church is true and that this is the Lord's work. We are just instruments, and he molds us to be what we need to be. I know that the church is true today and will always be true. I know that I've done all I can and served well. This isn't the end though. There's a lot more work that I can do. I love the gospel and I love the Lord. These things are real. God lives and so does Christ. The gospel isn't just a way of life, but it is life. I'll never go back to who I was before, but I'll strive to progress always. This is important for everyone. I know it's all true and real. In the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
