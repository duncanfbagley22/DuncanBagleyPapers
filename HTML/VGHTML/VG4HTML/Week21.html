            <h1>Week 21 <small>(May 11, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>The Rain in Spain</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
    It was so great/weird to talk to you, knowing that I'll see you soon. It's also super cool to have a little family reunion across the world. I had a great week. Just no complaints everything was great. We went to the temple this week. It's cool how now that I know that we should go to the temple with a question, every time I leave with a firm answer. It's cool how that works. I also had to give my "final testimony" in the zone conference. I thought it would be a weird feeling, but it wasnt. I'm just going to go over the miracles that happened this week. It was just raining miracles here in Pacata Alta.
<br><br>
1) We had 2 Spain related miracles. The first one was Wednesday. After giving a baptismal interview (the guy was suuuuuuper cool and really prepared), we went back to the area. We had an appointment with a guy I'd never met really, just a contact elder hansen made on an intercambio. We went and he wasnt there, then we started to leave. We got halfway down the street and he came running up and said he just got home. We went in, met his family and... found out they were almost baptized in Spain when they lived there. The 17yr old kid is super interested, has great questions. 
<br><br>
2) Temple trip, just cause I'm glad I have a temple in my mission
<br><br>
3) We were in a far away part of the area on saturday, somewhere I had been like once. There arent any members over there, but we decided to go contacting. We first met this pastor dude from an evangelical church. We talked and he was nice. Had a solid quote that I will mention at the end. He kept telling us to rethink our decision, that religion is bad and how we cant test the truthfulness of the BoM or the church. I told him to remember Matthew 16:17 and Peter, then we left. Like 5 minutes later we knocked a door and... met more people that knew missionaries in Spain. Shout out to missionaries in Spain. This time, one was a member and the other didnt get baptized because they moved. They were super happy to see us, and they should be able to progress. There's your proof that the church is true. 
<br><br>
4) Sunday. We had 9 people at church, the most I've had in a long long time. People just kept showing up and we just laughed, because half of them we didnt even expect to come. The best are Amanda and Lesli (who I have mentioned before) and Jhony (not the one that emailed dad). Jhony went from being a decent contact to a golden investigator. He and his 2yr old son came to church all dressed up and he loved it. We have a bunch of good investigators right now, it's all kinda like what we expect to happen to missionaries. I love it
<br><br>
So that was the week. I love you guys. Hope you have a great week.
<br><br>
Elder Bagley

p.s Happy Birthday Grandpa

                        <p>Cinco de mayo... is not a holiday in Bolivia. Today was a really good day. We had a bunch of lessons today. First we met this guy named Grover. He was ok. He showed us his rifles, something few Bolivian have. After that we just talked to Jhery for a bit. After lunch we went contacting. We found this one guy named Denis that was pretty good. Let us in and we taught a good little lesson. We also went to teach Adeleida, our cholita. We use a lot a quechua there. She actually listens and stuff, so she's not a terrible investigator. To end the night we went to teach Eric Torres. He's doing ok, he usually reads whatever we leave him. So that was our day. We've had a good start to the week, so hopefully it stays good.</p>

                        <p>Today was also a good day. First of all, we finally found drunk Willy, but this time he wasn't drunk. He's a lot different while sober. He wants to change a lot, so we'll try to help him. You can just see how terrible of a thing alcohol is. Willy is someone who needs the gospel really bad. Hopefully we can help him. We also taught a lady named Cecilia. We contacted her in the street earlier. Kinda slow to understand, but nice and listens. The coolest part of the day happened at night. We had an appt with this guy at night, but he wasn't there. We started to walk away when he came running up, as he'd just gotten home. Well, we went in and taught him and his brother. Turns out they, the Flia Pacheco, had been taught by missionaries in Spain. They're cool people. The middle son Denis, is especially interested. So even when things don't seem good here, it still turns out great.</p>

                        <p>Great day. A day has to be great when you start off with the temple. We went at 6 and had a great session. I went in with a question, and got a great answer. The Spirit just told me to keep looking forward. Really useful for me, especially going home. After the temple we had a zone conference. We spoke about finding more and stuff. Really good stuff. I also had to give my final zone conference testimony. Kind of a weird feeling, but not too bad. I didn't cry or anything. Sad that I won't have any more zone conferences. After everything was over we went back to the area. We were able to have a good little lesson with Cristian Orozco. He likes the BoM a lot, especially the BoM equivalent of Matthew 7:7. Really spiritual day, really enjoyed it.</p>

                      <p>Good day. In the morning we ran over to the mission home to drop off the Ipod that we confiscated from Elder Hernandez. After that we went back to the house and did weekly planning, my favorite. The afternoon was good, with some good lessons. First we went to teach Amanda and Lesli. We taught them the word of wisdom. It might be a harder thing for them than other commandments, especialmente (spanish?) for Leslie. I think they'll do fine though. After that we went and taught Richard and Gladys. They're doing really well. We just talked about the BoM and reading it. We ended the day talking to Jhery and Veronica. We basically just listened to their conversion story, which is always amazing to hear. We left their house at 9:29 and sprinted home. We got home right at 9:30pm. Just a really solid day.<br><br><br></p>

                    <p>Estoy aprovechando mi tiempo de estudio de idioma para poder escribir en mi diario, per tengo que hacerlo en espa√±ol. Hoy nos fue muy bien. En la ma√±ana fuimos a ense√±arle a Alejandro, un converso reciente, y despu√©s fuimos a Marlon. Mas que todo fue para decirle que si no quiere hacer nada, vamos a dejarle. En la tarde tuvimos una experiencia buena. Contactamos a un pastor evangelico. Amable, pero queria que nosotros dudaramos en nuestra iglesia y el Libro de Morm√≥n. A √©l le faltaba una direcci√≥n en su vida, pero no se da cuenta. Siempre nos dec√≠a que no hay evidencia de que el LDM es verdadero. A los 5 minotes despues, tocamos una puerta. All√≠, encontramos 2 jovenes. Uno, Cristian, es miembro, y su primo, David, no es miembro. Los 2 vinieron de Espa√±a, donde conocieron a los misioneros. All√≠ est√°, la evidencia de la verdad. Cuando volvimos al centro del √°rea, fuimos a ense√±arle a Cristian Orozco. Es muy bueno, solamenta necesita asistir. Terminamos el dia ense√±ando a Jhony Choque. Es buen√≠simo. Parece que se puede bautizar. Es tan humilde y busca la verdad. Me encanta ense√±arle. Eso es, y asi fue nuestro dia.</p>

                    <p>Wow. Good day. We got to church all normal and stuff. We had some hopes to have success, but we didn't imagine how good it would be. As we sat there, person after person kept showing up. We ended up with 9 investigators at church. Amanda, Leslie, Amanda's friend, Jhony C, Adeleida, Cecilia and her 2 grandkids, and one of Jhony Diaz's friends. We were just laughing because we had people showing up that we didn't expect. Great stuff. God just keeps blessing the area. After that we taught Lesli and Amanda, and then we went down to the bishop's hosue to skype our families. It was cool/weird to talk to them. I got to talk to Griffin too. Afterwards, I just talked to the bishop and this other guy that had lived in Utah. I felt important talking to them (this was all while Bradford talked to his family). So ya, good day. Success + talking to my family is always good.</p>

                    <p>3rd to last p-day. If anyone is wondering, the whole mission thing goes by so fast. Anyways, today was a pretty basic day. After studies we took a trufi (public transportation that I won't miss) down to the city to drop off some clothes at the dry cleaner. Then, we walked over to the correos (post office, but there're a bunch of shops over there) to look for things to buy. From there we walked over to the cancha to look at other things to buy. We had a lot of things to consider for me going home. We went out to Alalay where this old investigator of Bradford's measured me for a suit. We also quickly went buy his old pensionista's house. At night we quickly taught the Flia Pacheco and then we went down to teach Amanda and Lesli. Great day, I hate preparing to go home though.</p>
