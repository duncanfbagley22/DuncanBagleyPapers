            <h1>Week 21 <small>(May 11, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>The Rain in Spain</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
    It was so great/weird to talk to you, knowing that I'll see you soon. It's also super cool to have a little family reunion across the world. I had a great week. Just no complaints everything was great. We went to the temple this week. It's cool how now that I know that we should go to the temple with a question, every time I leave with a firm answer. It's cool how that works. I also had to give my "final testimony" in the zone conference. I thought it would be a weird feeling, but it wasnt. I'm just going to go over the miracles that happened this week. It was just raining miracles here in Pacata Alta.
<br><br>
1) We had 2 Spain related miracles. The first one was Wednesday. After giving a baptismal interview (the guy was suuuuuuper cool and really prepared), we went back to the area. We had an appointment with a guy I'd never met really, just a contact elder hansen made on an intercambio. We went and he wasnt there, then we started to leave. We got halfway down the street and he came running up and said he just got home. We went in, met his family and... found out they were almost baptized in Spain when they lived there. The 17yr old kid is super interested, has great questions. 
<br><br>
2) Temple trip, just cause I'm glad I have a temple in my mission
<br><br>
3) We were in a far away part of the area on saturday, somewhere I had been like once. There arent any members over there, but we decided to go contacting. We first met this pastor dude from an evangelical church. We talked and he was nice. Had a solid quote that I will mention at the end. He kept telling us to rethink our decision, that religion is bad and how we cant test the truthfulness of the BoM or the church. I told him to remember Matthew 16:17 and Peter, then we left. Like 5 minutes later we knocked a door and... met more people that knew missionaries in Spain. Shout out to missionaries in Spain. This time, one was a member and the other didnt get baptized because they moved. They were super happy to see us, and they should be able to progress. There's your proof that the church is true. 
<br><br>
4) Sunday. We had 9 people at church, the most I've had in a long long time. People just kept showing up and we just laughed, because half of them we didnt even expect to come. The best are Amanda and Lesli (who I have mentioned before) and Jhony (not the one that emailed dad). Jhony went from being a decent contact to a golden investigator. He and his 2yr old son came to church all dressed up and he loved it. We have a bunch of good investigators right now, it's all kinda like what we expect to happen to missionaries. I love it
<br><br>
So that was the week. I love you guys. Hope you have a great week.
<br><br>
Elder Bagley

p.s Happy Birthday Grandpa
