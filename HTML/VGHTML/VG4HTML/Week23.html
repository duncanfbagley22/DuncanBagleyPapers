            <h1>Week 23 <small>(May 25, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>That's All Folks</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
   So, this will be my last email. It's kinda weird to be here for the last time. I really dont know how to express the roller coaster of emotions. Honestly, it still doesnt feel real. I'll get to that end of the mission stuff at the end of the letter. There's still a lot of cool experiences to talk about. I dont really want to go through the day by day, but I will go through the 3 miracles that I enjoyed this week. 
<br><br>
1) Villa El Mar. There's this little town/pueblo type this like 40 minutes walking distance from the regular area. We went up there for the first time this week, just to see what it was like. We knocked a few doors and found a guy named David. I guess he has cancer and has had problems with churchs and stuff. He was super ready to listen and it was cool to find him. Best part, he went to church yesterday. That's like more than an hour round trip. Definitely was a blessing from God and a miracle to find someone like that in the middle of nowhere.
<br><br>
2) Amanda and Leslie. Nothing really changed this week, they're still doing very well. Their baptism is planned for May 30th, and I fully expect them to get there. They've had their interviews and everything. It's just amazing that I could find these people right at the end of my mission. They've turned down job offers to be able to go to church and they turn down coffee and stuff from friends. They're super ready. Just another miracle.
<br><br>
3) The Flia Garcia. So, we had the plans to go to the temple with them on Friday. We got there, ready to go and stuff, and saw that they didnt have a babysitter. They couldnt find anyone. However, like 30 minutes before we had the session, Richard's mom called and said she changed her mind and would take care of the kids. Then on the way there, we found out that we were running out of gas. We got to the door of the temple with basically no gas. When we got out we went to get more gas and ran out right when we got to the gas station. I thought we would be late for sure, but we were all ready at 7:28 (it was the 7:30 session). They hadnt been to the temple in more than 2 years, so it was super cool to be with them. Theyve changed so much in the 5 months I've been here. We were able to be in the session with most of the ward as well. I really dont know what could be a better experience. 
<br><br>
So that's this week. It's insane that I leave next week. I'm scared/excited/nervous/everything. This mission has changed my life. I'm a different person because of it. I will be eternally grateful for the opportunity that God gave me to serve here in Bolivia. I look back and realize how important everything I went through here was. Ive met so many special people and have seen so many miracles. More than anything, my testimony has grown sooooooooo much. I know that God lives, and that he loves me. I know that this is his church. Anytime I've had any doubts, he comes right back and shows me in a more obvious way that this is his church. I know that Christ is our Saviour and loves us. He is the most important person in our lives. I know that we have living prophets and that the priesthood is on the earth. I know that the Book of Mormon is true. I've felt its power so much here and seen the effect it has on lives. I know that families can be together forever and that the most important thing for anyone on earth is to live the gospel. Nothing will make us happier. I love the mission and I love Bolivia. I'm so grateful for these 2 years, and theyve been the best 2 so far. 
<br><br>
So, there ya go. I love you guys so much and thanks for everyone that supported me. Have a great week and I'll see ya soon (really soon)
<br><br>

                        <p>Woohoo, finished 23 months today. That's a lot of months. Today was pretty good. We had district/zone meeting in the morning. We started late because E' Hernandez decided to not bring the keys, even though that's always their job. I was a bit frustrated... Anyways, the meetings were good enough. After luch we went and showed Richard a little about family history and then we went to teach Amanda and Leslie about service. We then went to the offices. It's basically one of my areas. At night we went to teach Jhony C. Every time we teach him we end up leaving and praising him for being so cool. He's definitely someone that God led us too. It's just sad that his wife isn't interested. They'd be an amazing family, and will be one day. I love days when we teach our best investigators.</p>

                        <p>Not a bad day. In the morning we went out to Barrio Senac, because we had 2 appts. Both fell through though, so we had nothing to do. We decided to look for people. We didn't really find anyone until the end of the morning. We met some lady named Gladys in a tienda. She let us teach her and it went well. There's always something to do anywhere in the area. In the afternoon we had a few lessons. The best one was probably with Amanada and Leslie. We talked about the priesthood and it's role. They understand well, and don't have any objections. At night we had a special stake meeting with Pres Hansen, the stake presidency, and all the bishops and ward mission leaders. We talked about making ward councils better. President Hansen had some good ideas. Hopefully we can implement everything. We need the work to keep on growing.</p>

                        <p>Today was a bit frustrating. In the morning we did our studies and then weekly planning. That's probably my last weekly planning. Thank goodness. In the afternoon we went looking for the Joseph Smith movie. We ended up finding one. Not exactly the same one, but it had the same actors and stuff, so we figured it would be the same. We got to Amanda and Leslie's house to watch it, and part of the way in, we realized that it wasn't that great. Very boring moving, and we felt bad for watching it. Luckily, they enjoyed it enough. However, when we asked Marcia to share a testimony on Joseph Smith. She went off on a tangent and by the end of the lesson, we were both frustrated. Never using that movie again. We did have a great lesson with Jhonny to end the day. He's amazing, he'll read anything we leave him, just cause he's interested. "Golden" doesn't describe him enough. Now on to the last week of work.</p>

                      <p>Great day! Honestly, don't know how it could be better. In the morning we just went to see Richard and Gladys in preparation for the temple. In the afternoon we had 2 lessons. First with Cecilia. Despite being old, she actually kinda understands. After that we went way over to the other side of the area to teach a lady named Gladys Flores. We contacted her the other day in her tienda. She's good, super worried about her family. We also met up with a guy who brought me my new suit. Then, the craziness. We went to go pick up Richard and Gladys to go to the temple. First problem: they didn't have anyone who would babysit (they finally had someone call last minute who did it). 2nd problem: Their kid Cris didn't want them to leave (we ended up just leaving him crying). 3rd problem: We started running out of gas as we got there (we literally had just enough to get to the temple). By some miracle, we got there on time. It was one of the happiest experiences I've had. Being able to go with them to do a session, along with the whole ward. I think that's what heaven feels like. As we ended I spoke with some temple workers (Hno Parker and Rundquist) about finishing the mission. Really, I don't know how it could've been a better day.</p>

                    <h3>May 23, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Another great day. In the morning we studied and then we went to Amanda and Leslie's house where we ate breakfast and they had their baptismal interviews. Everything seems good to go for next Saturday. I'm still amazed that it's going to happen. After that we taught Cristian Orozco. We ate lunch and then we started up to Villa El Mar. It's the highest part of the area. The journey up there was... long, but we finally got up there. We contacted a few people and met this great guy named David who seems really prepared. The journey was worth it. It's super "tranquilo" up there, so I like it. When we got down we first went to visit Eric Torres. He's doing well, but he's on crutches for 3 weeks, so it'll be hard for him to go to church. We also taught Veronica to end the night. Jhery is struggling a bit, so we're trying to fix that. So anyways, even though today didn't seem promising, it turned out well.</p>

                    <p>Decently weird day. So we woke up normally... but then we realized that Bradford was really sick. By 6:45am he was just dying, so we started getting plans put together to do divisions. Bradford stayed home with E' Thornley, and I went to church with E' Morales. It was ward conference today, so it was pretty full. We had a lot of important people there. Amanda and Leslie, Flia Garcia, Jhery, and even that David guy we met yesterday. It was cool to see so many people there. After church I came home and stayed with Bradford until about 3. From there, we split up again. He stayed home with Jose Carlos Enovore, and I went with Jhonny to teach Amanda and Leslie. Solid lesson, just more about baptism. Then, I got back with Bradford. By about 6, Bradford was better, so we went out to work. We found the Flia rojas finally and taught them. They're doing well, a little bit more interested now. Also, did #s for the last time. About to start my last week. Scary...</p>

                    <h3>May 25, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Long p-day. Probably felt long because we got up at 5:30 and started hiking at 6:30. Since I'm leaving soon, I wanted to do something fun. We decided to hike up a mountain to an antenna. It was a decently long hike, but once we got there, there was a great view. We went up there with Alvaro Alanes. The way down was a bit tough. Bradford fell in a thornbush, but I came down ok. After we got down, we did internet and then we head to the kancha. I have the kancha, it's just super dirty and really Bolivian. But it has cheaper stuff. We bought all the possible souvenirs. It was a long day of lots of stuff for going home. At night we first had a lesson with Jhony C. He's the most prepared person I've taught. We left him 3 pamplets just cause he was curious, and he ended up reading them all and highlighting them. He's so ready, just awesome. And all this from a street contact. We also had an FHE with the Flia Valle. Awesome family. Pdte Valle told us an amazing story of when he had a run in with the people that killed the 2 missionaries in La Paz. They almost killed him, but something stopped them. Good FHE, great day.</p>
