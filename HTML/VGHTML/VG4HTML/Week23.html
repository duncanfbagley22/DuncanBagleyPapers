            <h1>Week 23 <small>(May 25, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>That's All Folks</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
   So, this will be my last email. It's kinda weird to be here for the last time. I really dont know how to express the roller coaster of emotions. Honestly, it still doesnt feel real. I'll get to that end of the mission stuff at the end of the letter. There's still a lot of cool experiences to talk about. I dont really want to go through the day by day, but I will go through the 3 miracles that I enjoyed this week. 
<br><br>
1) Villa El Mar. There's this little town/pueblo type this like 40 minutes walking distance from the regular area. We went up there for the first time this week, just to see what it was like. We knocked a few doors and found a guy named David. I guess he has cancer and has had problems with churchs and stuff. He was super ready to listen and it was cool to find him. Best part, he went to church yesterday. That's like more than an hour round trip. Definitely was a blessing from God and a miracle to find someone like that in the middle of nowhere.
<br><br>
2) Amanda and Leslie. Nothing really changed this week, they're still doing very well. Their baptism is planned for May 30th, and I fully expect them to get there. They've had their interviews and everything. It's just amazing that I could find these people right at the end of my mission. They've turned down job offers to be able to go to church and they turn down coffee and stuff from friends. They're super ready. Just another miracle.
<br><br>
3) The Flia Garcia. So, we had the plans to go to the temple with them on Friday. We got there, ready to go and stuff, and saw that they didnt have a babysitter. They couldnt find anyone. However, like 30 minutes before we had the session, Richard's mom called and said she changed her mind and would take care of the kids. Then on the way there, we found out that we were running out of gas. We got to the door of the temple with basically no gas. When we got out we went to get more gas and ran out right when we got to the gas station. I thought we would be late for sure, but we were all ready at 7:28 (it was the 7:30 session). They hadnt been to the temple in more than 2 years, so it was super cool to be with them. Theyve changed so much in the 5 months I've been here. We were able to be in the session with most of the ward as well. I really dont know what could be a better experience. 
<br><br>
So that's this week. It's insane that I leave next week. I'm scared/excited/nervous/everything. This mission has changed my life. I'm a different person because of it. I will be eternally grateful for the opportunity that God gave me to serve here in Bolivia. I look back and realize how important everything I went through here was. Ive met so many special people and have seen so many miracles. More than anything, my testimony has grown sooooooooo much. I know that God lives, and that he loves me. I know that this is his church. Anytime I've had any doubts, he comes right back and shows me in a more obvious way that this is his church. I know that Christ is our Saviour and loves us. He is the most important person in our lives. I know that we have living prophets and that the priesthood is on the earth. I know that the Book of Mormon is true. I've felt its power so much here and seen the effect it has on lives. I know that families can be together forever and that the most important thing for anyone on earth is to live the gospel. Nothing will make us happier. I love the mission and I love Bolivia. I'm so grateful for these 2 years, and theyve been the best 2 so far. 
<br><br>
So, there ya go. I love you guys so much and thanks for everyone that supported me. Have a great week and I'll see ya soon (really soon)
<br><br>
