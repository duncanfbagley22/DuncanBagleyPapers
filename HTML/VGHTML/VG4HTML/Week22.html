            <h1>Week 22 <small>(May 18, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>1 Million Minute Club</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
     This was a solid week. The success just kept on coming. Firstly, the title comes from the fact that this week I completed 1000000 minutes as a missionary. Elder Hansen and I would always talk about that being a cool milestone. That's a lot of minutes. I didnt have any other good ideas for a title either, so that was the only thing I could think of. Anyways, this is what happened this week.
<br><br>
Monday- Went pre-end of mission shopping/planning. Now I know what to get today and next monday. We also taught Amanda and Lesli at night.
<br><br>
Tuesday- After our zone meeting and stuff, we went to work. We went to the far corner of the area, where there's just a neat little community. It just seems nice, so we'll head back there. We've found a few people to teach over there, so it's cool. We also have been practicing with the sling shot that Bradford has. I finally hit my first dog (you might think that that is mean, but they all deserve it). We talked to Amanda and Lesli again that night and we have a solid date for May 30th, my last saturday in the mission. I think that they'll make it, I really hope so at least.
<br><br>
Wednesday- We had a few lessons throughout the day. The best one was at night. We went to teach Jhony with Sergio, our EQ President. He's like the best EQ president ever, and makes me laugh out loud in the lessons sometimes. Jhony is a real stud. He's not married or anything, so it'll be a while until he can be baptized. I think he will one day though.
<br><br>
Thursday- Slow day. We had weekly planning in the morning, and then we had to go to the offices in the afternoon. I still feel at home in the offices, but I cant imagine staying there all day. We also talked to Amanda and Lesli that night (I dont know if you can tell, but they're our best investigators).
<br><br>
Friday- Intercambio. I really enjoyed this one. I went with Elder Muñoz (the one that was my comp a year ago). I went with his to his area, which is just a bunch of open countryside type place. It felt just like working with him in El Paso. We had a really good time, just remembering the good ole days. My 3 months with him were some of my favorite times in the mission. We saw a bunch of miracles in El Paso, it was great. He's a good kid, fun to be with.
<br><br>
Saturday- Just regular work. The best part was teaching the Flia Garcia. They are now officially reactivated. They went and got their recommends again and all that. We are going to do some family history with them on Tuesday, then we are going to the temple with them on Friday. They are the best. Also, their son Cris makes me laugh so hard. At the end of the lesson, he was going to give the closing prayer. He was sitting in a cardboard box (he called it his car) and started praying. We heard something fall during the prayer. We cracked open our eyes to see, and Cris was now laying on the ground...still praying. He's the greatest.
<br><br>
Sunday- Church was good. we had like 5 people at church, which is still good. Afterwards we taught Amanda and Lesli, and then we went to a priesthood conference thingy. Calm day. It was good, we needed to relax a bit. Sundays are always just super tiring.
<br><br>
So that's that. People are starting to realize that I'm going home, so I'm sure I'll be busy this next week or so. I'll acknowledge the whole mission ending thing in the next email. Love you guys,
<br><br>
Elder Bagley (BAG-LAAAAAAAAAY as it is pronounced here)

                        <p>Today was pretty good. We had district and zone meetings in the morning. All good there. We did find out about emergency transfers for the Arocahua missionaries. They’ve just made the problem way worse than it really needed to be. Oh well, it’s over now. After lunch, we went over to the east side of the area, where we don't go a lot. We contacted a bit and got to know the area. It's really nice and clean over there, so I like being there. Afterwards we taught Adeleida a little bit, and then Amanda and Lesli. We talked mainly about baptism. It seems like both of them want to be baptized, so hopefully everything goes according. I’m still just amazed that God has blessed me by preparing them. Things always work, just in God’s time.</p>

                        <p>Happy birthday to my grandpa and my cousin Seth. Today wasn't super special or anything, but it was a good one. In the morning, we basically hiked around the western part of the area. In the afternoon we had a good number of lessons. We talked to Cecilia first. She’s doing well, she’s just a little slow. We also taught Cristian Orozco. He’s a good kid, he’s just a bit different. He always picks out weird things that he likes. We then went to teach Denis Pacheco. Really smart kid, and he seems interested. He could really progress. Finally at night we went with Sergio to teach Jhony. He’s amazing. Really interested. The only problem is that his wife isn’t interested and they aren’t married. If it wasn’t for that, he’d be perfect. Definitely want to stay in contact with him. He’s a miracle.</p>

                        <p>I love Thursdays… just kidding, for some reason I never have great numbers on Thursdays. We had studies and weekly planning in the morning. I’m just not going to complain about weekly planning, as I do that every Thursday. In the afternoon we went to the offices. I had to select my going home pictures, which was pretty tough. I’ve talked about doing that for my last year, so it’s weird to finally do it. We also took great $ pictures (me, Vega, and Farnsworth). After that we went to go teach Amanda and Lesli about the temple. The temple is the best part of everything, and it’s great that the temple is in Cochabamba. Now I’m in Huayllani on an intercambio, I’m with Elder Muñoz, my old comp. Tomorrow should be a fun day.</p>

                      <p>Intercambio day. It was a good one. It's almost a year ago to the date that we ended our time as companions, so it was kinda poetic. After studies and all that, we went out to work. Muñoz is a good missionary and he works really hard. The area we were working in felt a little like El PAso, so it just reminded me of that area. We taught a whole bunch of less actives. We did a bunch of stuff. We went through what felt like the jungle, I got chased by a sheep, etc. While we didn’t exactly have a great intercambio as far as the area goes, we did enjoy it and the memories it brought. We saw a bunch of miracles there and had a great time. Glad I’m a ZL so I could have the opportunity to do this intercambio.<br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <p>Today wasn’t super special. In the morning we did find a new family, the Flia Choque. Fun fact about here is that like have the peoples’ last names are Choque, Mamani, or Quispe. Diversity. Anyways, the family isn’t super amazing, but they’re not too bad. We taught the mom and the son. We also taught Cristian Orozco about repentance. After lunch we went to the chapl to see a member’s wedding. We got there, saw it, felt uncomfortable, and left. At night we went to go see Richard and Gladys. They apparently got the temple recommend interviews and are doing great. We watched a mormon message with them. They’re the best. After 5 months of working with them, they’re not active. To end the appt, Cris prayed. I guess he got tired in his prayer, so he laid down, and kept praying. Now I’m seeing the fruits of my labor.</p>

                    <p>Today was pretty good. We went to church and had 5 people there. It’s kind of amazing the difference of success from the last transfer to this one. God just opened the windows of heaven and poured out the blessings. It’s amazing. After church we went to lunch and then down to teach Amanda and Leslie. We just talked about missionary work (It’s one of my favorite topics). Then we just went to a stake priesthood meeting. We didn’t think anyone would go, but there actually was a good amount. It was kind of a long meeting, like 2hr and 15min. We didn’t have any time to do anything else, so we just went with Edmundo up to the pension. Edmundo, by the way, is one of the coolest people ever. Anyways, that was the day. Now I’m going to start my last full week. Weird thought.</p>

                    <p>Second to last p-day. Today was my last zone activity. Worst part of being a zone leader is planning activities. I did it super simple this time. We just went and played soccer and ping pong and stuff. Then we just had a guy in our ward bring us some peruvian food. It was really basic, but everyone was happy. After that, we went to go buy souvenirs (not sure how to spell that). I bought a whole bunch of stuff. It’s just so weird to be going home. At night we had a really cool FHE. We went over to Jhonny Diaz’s house and had an FHE with the whole mission prep class. There was like 10-12 people there, it was supe cool. The youth of this ward is really good. We talked about Patriarchal Blessings. It was solid. Not a bad p-day. I’m going to miss this ward.</p>
