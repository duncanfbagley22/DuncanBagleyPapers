            <h1>Week 22 <small>(May 18, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>1 Million Minute Club</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
     This was a solid week. The success just kept on coming. Firstly, the title comes from the fact that this week I completed 1000000 minutes as a missionary. Elder Hansen and I would always talk about that being a cool milestone. That's a lot of minutes. I didnt have any other good ideas for a title either, so that was the only thing I could think of. Anyways, this is what happened this week.
<br><br>
Monday- Went pre-end of mission shopping/planning. Now I know what to get today and next monday. We also taught Amanda and Lesli at night.
<br><br>
Tuesday- After our zone meeting and stuff, we went to work. We went to the far corner of the area, where there's just a neat little community. It just seems nice, so we'll head back there. We've found a few people to teach over there, so it's cool. We also have been practicing with the sling shot that Bradford has. I finally hit my first dog (you might think that that is mean, but they all deserve it). We talked to Amanda and Lesli again that night and we have a solid date for May 30th, my last saturday in the mission. I think that they'll make it, I really hope so at least.
<br><br>
Wednesday- We had a few lessons throughout the day. The best one was at night. We went to teach Jhony with Sergio, our EQ President. He's like the best EQ president ever, and makes me laugh out loud in the lessons sometimes. Jhony is a real stud. He's not married or anything, so it'll be a while until he can be baptized. I think he will one day though.
<br><br>
Thursday- Slow day. We had weekly planning in the morning, and then we had to go to the offices in the afternoon. I still feel at home in the offices, but I cant imagine staying there all day. We also talked to Amanda and Lesli that night (I dont know if you can tell, but they're our best investigators).
<br><br>
Friday- Intercambio. I really enjoyed this one. I went with Elder Muñoz (the one that was my comp a year ago). I went with his to his area, which is just a bunch of open countryside type place. It felt just like working with him in El Paso. We had a really good time, just remembering the good ole days. My 3 months with him were some of my favorite times in the mission. We saw a bunch of miracles in El Paso, it was great. He's a good kid, fun to be with.
<br><br>
Saturday- Just regular work. The best part was teaching the Flia Garcia. They are now officially reactivated. They went and got their recommends again and all that. We are going to do some family history with them on Tuesday, then we are going to the temple with them on Friday. They are the best. Also, their son Cris makes me laugh so hard. At the end of the lesson, he was going to give the closing prayer. He was sitting in a cardboard box (he called it his car) and started praying. We heard something fall during the prayer. We cracked open our eyes to see, and Cris was now laying on the ground...still praying. He's the greatest.
<br><br>
Sunday- Church was good. we had like 5 people at church, which is still good. Afterwards we taught Amanda and Lesli, and then we went to a priesthood conference thingy. Calm day. It was good, we needed to relax a bit. Sundays are always just super tiring.
<br><br>
So that's that. People are starting to realize that I'm going home, so I'm sure I'll be busy this next week or so. I'll acknowledge the whole mission ending thing in the next email. Love you guys,
<br><br>
Elder Bagley (BAG-LAAAAAAAAAY as it is pronounced here)
