            <h1>Week 20 <small>(May 4, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>TGIF</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
    I want to start and avoid all confusions on my title. It stands for (Thank Goodness It's Friday's). There is a Fridays here in Cocha (didnt see that one coming). I've been a few times, but it's kinda expensive. However, why would I need to go to Fridays if we have an investigator that works there. She's also our best investigator. I'm sure I mentioned Amanda and Leslie in the last letter (also know as the Flia Perez). They've been doing great. They've been to church a few times and have prayed and gotten answers. They love the missionaries, and members, and basically anyone who goes to their house. Because they work at Fridays, they've made/brought us brownies and keylime pie from Fridays. It's great, and making me fat. We were able to meet with them on Friday. Amanda said that she hadnt read... but she had prayed and gotten an answer. She said that that night she had a dream. In that dream, she said she saw Elder Bradford leading her somewhere. She didnt know where, but she followed. She said that she just saw that wherever they were going was super bright and white and all that and that she wanted to follow. Sounds like an answer to me. Over the past few weeks they've progressed so much. Pray for them, we're hoping to get them baptized in the next few weeks. They're definitely our best investigators for now.
<br><br>
We've also found a few more good investigators. A few weeks ago we contacted some guy at like 8:55pm. We taught him for the 2nd time yesterday and he is super interested. His name is Jhony. We've also taught this lady who speaks mostly Quechua. Our pensionista comes with us and translates the things that she doesnt understand. I just use it as a chance to use my quechua. Elder Hansen taught me how to invite people to church. Domingota Jamunki Iglesiaman. Ñoqa kani Estados Unidosmanta (I am from the USA). Chayqa Rumi (that is a rock). I know like 2.1 languages. 
<br><br>
We also had the Consejo de Lideres on Wednesday. We talked about helping people to make and keep commitments. It was really good. We had to teach a zone class on the same thing on Friday and it went great. Really spiritual. It mustve worked, because the zone got so much better this week. We were super happy with them.
<br><br>
Last but not least, we had to deal with companionship problems. We spent like 2 and a half hours interviewing the missionaries in a certain area in the zone and trying to solve things. The joys of leadership.
<br><br>
So that was the week. Hope everything goes well for you all, and we'll talk on Sunday.
<br><br>
Elder Bagley

                        <p>Good start to the week. After doing our studies and things we went out to work. In the morning we went to go visit Drunk Willy. He's this guy that's been drunk for about a whole week. Alcohol is a big problem. We couldn't teach him, cause he was drunk, but we did teach his wife Flora. She definitely needs our help. We also met 2 other new people to teach. One was a new guy named Nicanor. He's a taxi driver we met knocking doors. We also taught a cholita named Adeleida. She was nice, but we had Hna Quiroga there to speak a little Quechua. It's cool to hear the gospel in Quechua. Finally, we ended the day teaching a kid named Jose. He's a friend of Jhony's. He doesn't live in our area, but he's pretty cool. Good investigator. That's all why is was a good day.</p>

                        <p>Consejo day. Today was my last consejo de lideres.  I've been to every single one for the last year, so it's weird that I won't have another one. In the morning before the consejo we went and taught Kevin. He's not progressing at all, so he needs our help. After that we ran out to Esmeralda to pick up a suitcase, and then we went to the consejo. It was really good. We learned about inviting people to make commitments and helping them to keep them. It really struck me that Elder Ortiz said that we should invite people to do things as if they were a loved one. I guess his mom was receiving the missionaries for the first time today, so he tries to teach people with the same importance as he’d teach his mom. After the consejo wrapped up, we head home, but we couldn’t find anyone to teach. Valerio and Salazar are spending the night here, so we’re just talking now. Again, weird to be done with consejo.</p>

                        <p>And there goes April. Time goes by so fast here.Today was pretty good, most everything went according to plan. We had studies and weekly planning in the morning. Weekly planning always changes for me. I've just never found a way that I like best. After planning we went out to work. We had a lesson with Amanda. She's doing well. Her mom showed up late, but we still saw them both. They've quickly become our best investigators. After teaching them a little, we went and talked to the Flia Garcia. They’re progressing well. Everytime we go there Cris makes me laugh way too much. Finally, we were able to go talk to Jhery and Veronica. It was great to finally have them meet Bradford. They’re doing ok. We ended the night with ward council being cancelled. We were at the chapel, but without consejo. We got blessed today, as we didn’t have anyone to go with us to visit Amanda, but we found Hno Ferrufino at the last minute.</p>

                      <p>And now we’re in May. The last month of my mission. Kinda a weird feeling. Today was good though. After studies and what not, we had zone meeting. Bradford and I had to give a class on what we learned in the consejo de lideres. I think it went well, it was very spiritual. After that, we had to talk to the Arocahua missionaries who are having problems. I also sent for scripture cases to be made. We had a good afternoon. We taught Amanda and Lesli. They gave us more brownies. We had a really good lesson with them and they’re doing great. We also taught Adeleida, a cholita. Hna Quiroga helped with a little Quechua. I invited her to church in Quechua “Domingota Jamunki Iglesiaman”. Solid day, I’m loving the progress in the area.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <p>Well today was… interesting. We had to go to Arocahua today to solve some problems. They’re having companionship problems. We spent a good 2 ½ hours doing little interviews and stuff. It’s frustrating working with missionaries sometimes. All 4 are just being selfish and prideful. However, in solving problems you learn what not to do. We had to make emergency intercambio with them and other elders in the zone, because they couldn’t stand being with each other. Uh… On the bright side we did have a solid day working. I like our area, because it’s up and far from everyone else, so we can just focus on us. We taught a kid named Eric Torres. He’s 18, but he looks like he’s 30. We had a good lesson though, he’s interested so we could go somewhere with him. So ya, I’m kinda tired of dealing with problems, but I like missionary work.</p>

                    <h3>May 3, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Today was pretty good. We had 2 people at church again. Lesli and Amanda showed up and they seem to be progressing quite well. It's cool in this ward, because we bring people to church and the members just attack them and say hi and become friends super fast. It's great. We had 2 lessons after church. We got our lunch late, and because of that we didn't eat much cause we had to run to a lesson. We taught Lesli and Amanda about chastity and keeping the sabbath day holy. No huge problems for them, but I honestly think the sabbath day is the hardest thing for people here. We also had a lesson with Jhony Choque. He’s doing well. He’s really interested. We took Ivan with us and we talked about the BoM. He’s probably our 2nd best investigator as of right. Good way to end a great week.</p>

                    <p>Today was a decent p-day, even though we didn’t plan any of it. We did our studies and then we just head down to the circuvalación. On the way, we saw some missionaries playing soccer on the synthetic field. So, we ran back home, changed, and went and played. It was really fun, it was a good group. I’m still good enough, so it’s always fun. After that we dropped off our laundry, and then we went to go eat lunch quickly with some other elders, and then we went to write our families. After writing our families and buying groceries, we went home and rested. Our FHE for the night was the mission prep class and the Flia Chocala. We just spoke about the scriptures and stuff. Good stuff. Good day. Just everything is good.</p>
