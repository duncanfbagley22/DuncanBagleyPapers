            <h1>Week 19 <small>(April 27, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>mein Begleiter kommt aus Deutschland</h3>
            <p><small>Guten Morgen allerseits,<br>
     No, I don't know German. I title my email because of something that happened a lot this week. So, now I'm with my companion Elder Bradford, from Murrieta California. He's been out for about 16 months. We've been working great and it's been a good week. It's going to be a great transfer. He told me a story about how some drunk guy in his other area insisted that Elder Bradford was from Germany. Well, every time some drunk guy comes up and talks to us (happens like every other day) I just tell them that he's from Germany. They all believe it and start speaking "german" back to him. It's just sad to see drunk guys. They always say how much they wanna change, but then they just drink some more. Alcohol causes their problems, then they get sad because they have problems, then think drink to feel better. Enough about drunks, here's what happened this week. 
<br><br>
Monday- I just ran around with Elder Vanegas in his area. Didnt really find much to do.
<br><br>
Tuesday- I left in the morning to pick up Elder Bradford. We got to the area, studied, and then worked. We had a good lesson with a guy named Cristian. He's pretty interested. We met him at the store and since then he's been great. He reads and does all that. We also taught a family, the Flia Rojas, at night. They work for the stake patriach's business and are really cool. The wife has read a little, the dad too. They arent huge on commitment, but we have a lesson tonight, so hopefully we can get them going.
<br><br>
Wednesday- We got back to work and had another good day. We taught a recent convert Alejandro in the morning. He's like 14, and a little crazy, but a good kid. In the afternoon we taught a few more lessons and just had a good day. 
<br><br>
Thursday- We had another lesson with Cristian in the afternoon. He understands everything, we're just working on getting him an answer. We also taught the Flia Perez (Amanda and Leslie). They're doing well and progressing. They also got us brownies for the lesson. They're our best investigators for the moment. We also had ward council at night.
<br><br>
Friday- We had our district/zone meeting in the morning. The zone is very different from last transfer. We'll have a few more challenges this transfer, but nothing we cant handle. We had to go to the offices in the afternoon, and spend a good amount of time planning a special musical number (no one in our zone has talent, so we had to call around Cocha looking for hnas that can sing).
<br><br>
Saturday- Busy day. In the morning we had to move some stuff out of a house in the zone. Then we had to go practice for the musical numbers. We had stake conference this weekend, and the stake president asked us to provide a musical number. Me, and Elder from Peru, and 2 northamerican hnas sang 2 hymns in stake conference. I think it went very well. We had priesthood and the adult session in the afternoon/night, so that's what we did. We had to bring in Elder Farnsworth, who used to be in the zone, to play piano, so he stayed at our house.
<br><br>
Sunday- We had to go to conference all morning to sing. They did 2 sessions of conference in 2 different chapels, because our stake is so big geographically. We had Amanda and Leslie there, as well as the Flia Garcia. The Flia Garcia is re reactivating, but they're doing well. We had a lesson in the afternoon with the Flia Perez, where they gave us like 5 pieces of cake. They're going to make key lime pie for next thursday. We also taught a guy named Jhony at night. Really cool guy. We contacted him at like 8:55pm a few weeks ago, but could never find him. Finally found him, and he's great. 
<br><br>
So that was the day. The area is doing a lot better and hopefully we can keep it progressing. I love you guys so much, see you later.
<br><br>
Elder Bagley
