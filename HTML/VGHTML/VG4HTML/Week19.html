            <h1>Week 19 <small>(April 27, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>mein Begleiter kommt aus Deutschland</h3>
            <p><small>Guten Morgen allerseits,<br>
     No, I don't know German. I title my email because of something that happened a lot this week. So, now I'm with my companion Elder Bradford, from Murrieta California. He's been out for about 16 months. We've been working great and it's been a good week. It's going to be a great transfer. He told me a story about how some drunk guy in his other area insisted that Elder Bradford was from Germany. Well, every time some drunk guy comes up and talks to us (happens like every other day) I just tell them that he's from Germany. They all believe it and start speaking "german" back to him. It's just sad to see drunk guys. They always say how much they wanna change, but then they just drink some more. Alcohol causes their problems, then they get sad because they have problems, then think drink to feel better. Enough about drunks, here's what happened this week. 
<br><br>
Monday- I just ran around with Elder Vanegas in his area. Didnt really find much to do.
<br><br>
Tuesday- I left in the morning to pick up Elder Bradford. We got to the area, studied, and then worked. We had a good lesson with a guy named Cristian. He's pretty interested. We met him at the store and since then he's been great. He reads and does all that. We also taught a family, the Flia Rojas, at night. They work for the stake patriach's business and are really cool. The wife has read a little, the dad too. They arent huge on commitment, but we have a lesson tonight, so hopefully we can get them going.
<br><br>
Wednesday- We got back to work and had another good day. We taught a recent convert Alejandro in the morning. He's like 14, and a little crazy, but a good kid. In the afternoon we taught a few more lessons and just had a good day. 
<br><br>
Thursday- We had another lesson with Cristian in the afternoon. He understands everything, we're just working on getting him an answer. We also taught the Flia Perez (Amanda and Leslie). They're doing well and progressing. They also got us brownies for the lesson. They're our best investigators for the moment. We also had ward council at night.
<br><br>
Friday- We had our district/zone meeting in the morning. The zone is very different from last transfer. We'll have a few more challenges this transfer, but nothing we cant handle. We had to go to the offices in the afternoon, and spend a good amount of time planning a special musical number (no one in our zone has talent, so we had to call around Cocha looking for hnas that can sing).
<br><br>
Saturday- Busy day. In the morning we had to move some stuff out of a house in the zone. Then we had to go practice for the musical numbers. We had stake conference this weekend, and the stake president asked us to provide a musical number. Me, and Elder from Peru, and 2 northamerican hnas sang 2 hymns in stake conference. I think it went very well. We had priesthood and the adult session in the afternoon/night, so that's what we did. We had to bring in Elder Farnsworth, who used to be in the zone, to play piano, so he stayed at our house.
<br><br>
Sunday- We had to go to conference all morning to sing. They did 2 sessions of conference in 2 different chapels, because our stake is so big geographically. We had Amanda and Leslie there, as well as the Flia Garcia. The Flia Garcia is re reactivating, but they're doing well. We had a lesson in the afternoon with the Flia Perez, where they gave us like 5 pieces of cake. They're going to make key lime pie for next thursday. We also taught a guy named Jhony at night. Really cool guy. We contacted him at like 8:55pm a few weeks ago, but could never find him. Finally found him, and he's great. 
<br><br>
So that was the day. The area is doing a lot better and hopefully we can keep it progressing. I love you guys so much, see you later.
<br><br>
Elder Bagley

                        <p>I've finally got a companion! We woke up and went to the Universided stake center where we met up with our companions. We hung out there for a bit and then me and Bradford came back here to Pacata Alta. He unpacked and then we studied. After lunch we went and taught this kid Cristian Orozco. We met him contacting and he's pretty solid. We taught all of lesson one and it went great. Hopefully he progresses. We also were able to teach Marlon. Later in the day we finally found a contact, Lourdes. Her husband is Eric Rojas. We had a good lesson and finally got back in contact with the family. At night we had a run in with a drunk guy that we'd been looking for and got in contact with another family we were looking for. Great things are happening since Bradford's gotten here.</p>

                        <p>Today was another good day. Well, in the morning we taught Alejandro, a recent convert. He's kinda crazy, but he's a good kid. In the afternoon we went to talk to the Flia Garcia. We had a good lesson, and then we left. Then we went back an hour later and taught their friend Kendi there. We're making good progress with the family, so I'm happy. They've been in a downward spiral, but I thihnk we're getting them back up. They're a special family, and they need to be active. At night we were able to teach the Flia Rojas. They understand pretty well and I think they're starting to be a little bit more interested. Anyways, things are going well with Bradford so far so hopefully we can keep it up.</p>

                        <p>Today also was a good day. In the morning we had studies and then weekly planning my favorite activity. The afternoon was great though. First we went with Alvaro to go teach Cristian Orozco. He's doing well. He reads and has questions. I think he understands now why we go and how he can figure out if it is true. Hopefully he gets an answer. We also taught Ivan for a little Just watched a video. Finally we had a lesson with Amanda and Leslie. To start, the brought us brownies from Fridays. They we had a really good lesson. We taught the Plan of Salvation. We even put a fecha, May 23rd. Hopefully they keep progressing. We ended the night with ward council. Good day, no complaints.</p>

                      <p>Today was a little bit more difficult than the last few. We woke up, studied, and then we went to the district meeting. The zone is different from last transfer. We'll probably have a few more problems. No one really pays too much attention. There's only a hand full of missionaries that I'm excited to work with. It'll be ok though, I like challenges. It'll be tough, but I'm sure we'll be able to help in something. After the meeting we ate lunch and went to the office. We spent a good amount of time there, calling people and trying to find someone for our musical number. We did end up finding someone though. The rest of the night we tried to find some people to teach, but no one was home to receive us. Challenging day, much room to improve.<br><br></p>

                    <h3>April 25, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Today was busy. after studying we went to Frutillar to move the stuff out of the old Hermanas' house. One of the things I've done a lot on my mission is move furniture. I'm like a pro now. After that we went to the chapel where we practiced for a bit for the musical numbers in stake conference. Glad we got that figured out. We also picked up Elder Farnsworth to be with us. While stake conference might seem like an easy, laid back event, it wasn't. We had 6 elders show up late to (like 30min) the priesthood session. We also had 2 sisters just not go to the adult session. I'm also fasting, so it was a fun night. It was good to hear some good talks though. Tomorrow will be a lot of the same.</p>

                    <h3>April 26, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Another busy day. We woke up early and went to pick up Amanda and Leslie for church. They made us breakfast, which wasn't great for me as I was fasting. After that we rushed to church. Stake conference wasn't super full, but it was good. We did a musical number (me, E' Torres, E' Farnsworth, H' Lomax, and H' Hullinger). We had to go to both sessions (we have 2 sessions because the stake is big geographically), which was tiring. Afterwards we had a lesson with Amanda and Leslie. We talked about the scriptures and their importance. It went well. We also had a lesson at night with a guy named Jhony. He's someone I contacted a while ago, but we finally taught him. It wwent well, he could be a great investigator. Honestly, I'm glad the week is over.</p>

                    <p>Good p-day. We woke up and studied and stuff, then we went to do internet. Nothing too special. Elder Hansen wrote me which was kinda cool. After internet we went to Luigi's. We decided that we would just have a regular Luigi's + futsal at the university stake center p-day, so that's what we did. It was weird though, just cause I felt really old. After that we went and played soccer. It was really fun. We had a team of my, Bradford, Jafek, Reyes, and Delamare that destroyed. We won like 10 times in a row. I don't know how we kept winning, but we did. It was super fun. At night we had a few appts fall through, but we did get a lesson with Waldo. He's doing just ok. So ya, good day. I had a lot of fun.</p>
