            <h1>Week 7 <small>(February 2, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>7 up</h3>
            <p><small>Dear family,<br>
    This was a somewhat hectic week. Changes are always like that, but for me it was especially crazy. With Elder Hansen coming from the offices (he was in charge of materials and packages and stuff), I had to wait until Thursday to be with him. Because of that, I had 7 different companions this week. Dont worry, I'll explain each and every one of them. Here's the rundown...
<br><br>
Monday- I was with Elder Laidlaw *COMPANION 1* still. We just hung around with Elder Valerio and Elder Skousen all day. At night, we had different little FHE's with various people. The most awkward thing of being a missionary is when your companion leaves and everyone is sad and you just kinda sit there like an awkward third wheel. That's how it was monday. Everyone loved him here, so we'll have to work hard to get to the same level
<br><br>
Tuesday- We went and dropped Laidlaw off at the airport and then went to the stake center where all the missionaries were meeting. We went with Jhery (a recent convert) and after we dropped off Laidlaw, just me and Jhery *COMPANION 2* drove over to the stake center. From there, I picked up Elder Tronson *COMPANION 3*. He is from our zone and training a new missionary, but he didnt have a companion for tuesday, so I went with him. We had a really solid lesson with Lilian about the plan of salvation. She really liked it. After that Elder Tronson felt kinda sick, and by the time we got to his area, he had a really bad migraine and we just ended up staying at his house so he could sleep. I just relaxed, listened to talks, and studied a bit. 
<br><br>
Wednesday- Tronson slept and felt better, and Wednesday morning I had to take him to his training meeting. From there, Elder Toomer *COMPANION 4* came and picked me up because he lived close. I studied there at his house, until Richard *COMPANION 5* came and picked me up in his taxi. He's a less active (actually, we finished up this week so now he's active technically). He drove me back to my area, where I met up with Jose Carlos *COMPANION 6*. He's a 17yr old kid in our ward that came with me for the afternoon. We had a few lessons and it was pretty productive, at least for a day like that. He came with me down to the chapel where I finally met up with Elder Hansen *COMPANION 7*. We had a meeting with Pres Hansen and the stake president, just to talk about the work in the stake and stuff. At night we taught this guy named Abel. Really nice guy, but too atheist to really listen.
<br><br>
Thursday- Throwback Thursday. Hansen still needed to finish training his replacement, so we spent all day in the office. I went to my old house, spent time in my old office, and I even got to eat at my old pensionista's house. It was cool to see them again. Being in the office was pretty boring. When you dont actually work there, it isnt super fun. I spent time updating my area book and stuff like that, just to feel like I wasnt wasting time. At night we just had ward council.
<br><br>
Friday- We had zone meeting. The zone is still pretty good, we got a lot of good missionaries that came in. The administrative stuff took a while, so we got home later. We had a lesson with Marlon in the afternoon. It's funny, he's a dentist, so me and Laidlaw always left him "prescriptions" or homework to read and stuff. He's done pretty well with that. I was scared that he'd miss Laidlaw too much, but it was good. At night we met with Jhery and Veronica. They went over their whole conversion story and it's probably the most miraculous one I've heard here. They've changed so much and just from the stuff that happened to them (like how Jhery had a dream about President Monson before seeing him or knowing anything about him) you can tell that God really prepared them.
<br><br>
Saturday- Rough day, but good finish. We had a lesson with Nora, and the Relief Society president came with us. We talked about Joseph Smith and all that. Nora is older, so we teach slowly, but she's making progress. We had to goal to make contact with 10 new people that day. We went all over the place. We got to 10, but we had some time left. We passed this door and I felt like we should knock it. We did, and the guy was super nice, let us in, we taught, and we have an appt for Wednesday. It was textbook, contacting 1 more person and that one ends up being the best. Made my day for sure. At night we talked to Richard, just a good lesson about the church.
<br><br>
Sunday- Started great. Nora came to church and finally Marlon came. Plus a few less actives. Church was just regular. After church, and lunch, we worked. Nothing happened. We went up and down the area and everything fell through. At 6, after our best appt fell through, we just sat down and said a prayer asking for something to do. We got up, turned the corner, and saw some members walking up the street. Although we didnt have a lesson, we got to know them and they gave us a reference. Who knows why, but it was an answer to our prayer.
<br><br>
So that's the week. Kinda crazy, but things have calmed down now. Hopefully itll be a good week this week as well. Love you guys<br>
Elder Bagley
