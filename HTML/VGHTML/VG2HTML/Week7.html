            <h1>Week 7 <small>(February 2, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>7 up</h3>
            <p><small>Dear family,<br>
    This was a somewhat hectic week. Changes are always like that, but for me it was especially crazy. With Elder Hansen coming from the offices (he was in charge of materials and packages and stuff), I had to wait until Thursday to be with him. Because of that, I had 7 different companions this week. Dont worry, I'll explain each and every one of them. Here's the rundown...
<br><br>
Monday- I was with Elder Laidlaw *COMPANION 1* still. We just hung around with Elder Valerio and Elder Skousen all day. At night, we had different little FHE's with various people. The most awkward thing of being a missionary is when your companion leaves and everyone is sad and you just kinda sit there like an awkward third wheel. That's how it was monday. Everyone loved him here, so we'll have to work hard to get to the same level
<br><br>
Tuesday- We went and dropped Laidlaw off at the airport and then went to the stake center where all the missionaries were meeting. We went with Jhery (a recent convert) and after we dropped off Laidlaw, just me and Jhery *COMPANION 2* drove over to the stake center. From there, I picked up Elder Tronson *COMPANION 3*. He is from our zone and training a new missionary, but he didnt have a companion for tuesday, so I went with him. We had a really solid lesson with Lilian about the plan of salvation. She really liked it. After that Elder Tronson felt kinda sick, and by the time we got to his area, he had a really bad migraine and we just ended up staying at his house so he could sleep. I just relaxed, listened to talks, and studied a bit. 
<br><br>
Wednesday- Tronson slept and felt better, and Wednesday morning I had to take him to his training meeting. From there, Elder Toomer *COMPANION 4* came and picked me up because he lived close. I studied there at his house, until Richard *COMPANION 5* came and picked me up in his taxi. He's a less active (actually, we finished up this week so now he's active technically). He drove me back to my area, where I met up with Jose Carlos *COMPANION 6*. He's a 17yr old kid in our ward that came with me for the afternoon. We had a few lessons and it was pretty productive, at least for a day like that. He came with me down to the chapel where I finally met up with Elder Hansen *COMPANION 7*. We had a meeting with Pres Hansen and the stake president, just to talk about the work in the stake and stuff. At night we taught this guy named Abel. Really nice guy, but too atheist to really listen.
<br><br>
Thursday- Throwback Thursday. Hansen still needed to finish training his replacement, so we spent all day in the office. I went to my old house, spent time in my old office, and I even got to eat at my old pensionista's house. It was cool to see them again. Being in the office was pretty boring. When you dont actually work there, it isnt super fun. I spent time updating my area book and stuff like that, just to feel like I wasnt wasting time. At night we just had ward council.
<br><br>
Friday- We had zone meeting. The zone is still pretty good, we got a lot of good missionaries that came in. The administrative stuff took a while, so we got home later. We had a lesson with Marlon in the afternoon. It's funny, he's a dentist, so me and Laidlaw always left him "prescriptions" or homework to read and stuff. He's done pretty well with that. I was scared that he'd miss Laidlaw too much, but it was good. At night we met with Jhery and Veronica. They went over their whole conversion story and it's probably the most miraculous one I've heard here. They've changed so much and just from the stuff that happened to them (like how Jhery had a dream about President Monson before seeing him or knowing anything about him) you can tell that God really prepared them.
<br><br>
Saturday- Rough day, but good finish. We had a lesson with Nora, and the Relief Society president came with us. We talked about Joseph Smith and all that. Nora is older, so we teach slowly, but she's making progress. We had to goal to make contact with 10 new people that day. We went all over the place. We got to 10, but we had some time left. We passed this door and I felt like we should knock it. We did, and the guy was super nice, let us in, we taught, and we have an appt for Wednesday. It was textbook, contacting 1 more person and that one ends up being the best. Made my day for sure. At night we talked to Richard, just a good lesson about the church.
<br><br>
Sunday- Started great. Nora came to church and finally Marlon came. Plus a few less actives. Church was just regular. After church, and lunch, we worked. Nothing happened. We went up and down the area and everything fell through. At 6, after our best appt fell through, we just sat down and said a prayer asking for something to do. We got up, turned the corner, and saw some members walking up the street. Although we didnt have a lesson, we got to know them and they gave us a reference. Who knows why, but it was an answer to our prayer.
<br><br>
So that's the week. Kinda crazy, but things have calmed down now. Hopefully itll be a good week this week as well. Love you guys<br>
Elder Bagley

                        <p>Another interesting day. In the morning we went to drop Laidlaw off. We got to see the news come in, my 7th time doing that. After that, Jhery took me over to teh Universidad stake center. From there, I picked up Elder Tronson. I was with him all day because he's not getting his companion until tomorrow. In the morning we had a really good lesson with Lilian. She really liked the Plan of Salvation. I'm hoping she progresses. After that, Tronson got really sick. We set up appointments and stuff, but by the time we got to his area, he couldn't go any more. The rest of the afternoon he just slept. I listened to some talks, relaxed a little, met up with Elder Olson and Elder Samayoa to get some keys, and then I studied a bit. I learned about miracles and it was a really good study. Good spirit. Tomorrow should be crazier, so we'll see what happens.</p>

                        <p>Crazy day. At seven I went to drop off E’ Tronson for his training meeting. From there, I went to Elder Toomer's house for studies. From there, Hno Richard picked me up in his taxi and took me up to my area. There I met up with Jose Carlos Enaborre, a kid that spent the afternoon with me. We had 2 decent lessons. We first talked to Beatriz, a sister of a less active. she's nice, not super interested, but interested enough to keep going. We also talked to Nora. We teach in little portions, but she's progressing. It might take a while to get baptized, but it's possible. After that, Jose dropped me off with Elder Hansen. We then had a meeting with Pdte Hansen and Pdte Velasco (stake pres). We just talked about the work in the stake. It went pretty well. Hansen and I had a lesson at night with a guy named Abel. He's a little frustrating, because he says he doesn't believe in God, but you can tell he kinda does. He's very stubborn though. Good day, a little crazy, but good.</p>

                        <p>Throwback Thursday. Today, I went back to the offices. In the morning we went to the secretary house so Hansen could pack. After that we went to the office. It was kinda weird going back, but it was ok. I spent a lot of time there doing teaching records and trying to not waste the day. I just sat in Vegas's office the whole day. For lunch, I got to go to my old pension. I didn't say goodbye before, so I was glad to go today. After that, we just went to the office. Nothing too special. Towards the end of the night, after we had left, I was getting a little stressed, which isn't good. I got over it though. We had consejo de barrio at night. Our ward is really really good. We’d say things that we wanted done and they’d have a perfect answer. I love our ward.</p>

                      <p>Today was the first zone meeting for the new Zona Sacaba. Our district meeting was great. Our DL is E’ Meadows, who was a ZL for like 9 months. He is experienced and did a good job. Zone meeting was ok, we have good missionaries. After lunch, we had a lesson with Marlon. I was scared that he and Jhanet wouldn't warm up to us, but it went fine. We just talked about the BoM and stuff. After that, we contacted a bunch, but didn't get that much out of of it. At night we had a lesson with Jhery and Veronica. Another time I thought they wouldn't warm up too well, but it was great. They recounted their conversion story and it really is incredible. Just so many miracles happened. They're just a spectacular family. Overall it was a decent day, not too bad.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <p>It's the last day of January. That's just weird. Today was rough, but it turned out ok. After studying, we looked over the map and made some good plans to work better. After that, we went out and worked, but we really didn’t find anything. After lunch we went with Hna Flor to visit Nora. it was a decent lesson, she's progressing all those slowly. After that, we went and looked for people. We went all over the place contacting. We set a goal to contact 10 people. Of the 10, maybe 2 were good. However, the 11th guy was good. I felt like I should knock his door. We met this guy named Jose Manuel. He let us in, we talked, and got a return appointment. Really awesome. Finally at night we talked to Richard and Gladys. They're still just awesome. So yeah, a rough workday, but I feel good about it.</p>

                    <h3>February 1, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Happy February!!! Today was good, bad, and ugly. We had 2 people at church today. Nora came again, and finally we got Marlon to church. I was so happy to see him come in. That's the good. The bad is that Jhery didn't go to church. He and Veronica fought in the morning, so to “get back at her” he doesn’t go to church. It's happened before, but we need to try to fix it. The ugly was that we didn't have a single lesson today. We worked all day, but everything fell through. We even had Jhony and Jose Carlos with us. After our 6 o'clock appointment fell through, we prayed to find something. We got up, turned the corner, and saw some members. They invited us over and gave us a reference. No huge miracle, but an answer to a prayer. It's good enough for me.</p>

                    <h3>February 2, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Groundhog day! Today was a decent p-day. In the morning, we did some hard workout called "Focus T-25". Hard stuff.  We did internet regular and stuff. We had a stressful little session there as we were trying to get decided on where to live in college and stuff. Super 4. after that, we went to the city. We took out money, went to the supermarket, and bought lunch. After that, we went to the stake center and played futsal. We made a secretary team with Davis, Vega, and Walton and we did pretty well. After that, and dinner, we were supposed to have an FHE with Marlon and Jhanet, but it fell through. We ended up going to the Rivera's house and talking with them and Jhery's family. That rescued the day, so it was ok.</p>
