            <h1>Week 11 <small>(March 2, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>Mufasa</h3>
            <p><small>Okee doke family,<br>
    This was an interesting week. Good things happened, we got frustrated at times, and just all sorts of fun stuff. It's weird that we're into march now. I bunch of my mission buddies, like Elder Laidlaw for example, are going home in just one week. I remember meeting that group when they had like 4 months. Time just keeps flying. Cambios are this next week, so I'm a little nervous/anxious. If I stay, I'll end here, and if not I'll end in the next area. It's the cambio that'll decide my mission. I cant focus on that too much though. Anyways, this is what happened this week.
<br><br>
Monday- Pday at the mission home. It was really fun. We played games and basketball and stuff. Our zone is pretty cool. At night, we had a quick lesson with the Flia Porco and then we had an FHE with the 1st counselor in the stake presidency and his family. Super cool family. The parents are both RMs and the daughter just got back a week ago from her mission in Paraguay. They help a lot in the work. Awesome people.
<br><br>
Tuesday- It was just a regular day. We had district and zone meeting and then we went to the office. We had one lesson with a recent convert named Ivan. He was found knocking doors and the only reason he talked to the missionaries was cause he watched south park and heard about the church. Fun fact.
<br><br>
Wednesday- We did an intercambio. I went with Elder Salas from Peru/Sandy. Remember when Aunt Sherry told us about her stake president's adopted son that was going to my mission. Yup, that guy. I took a picture, dont worry. We had a good day. At night we contacted some really cool guy. Doesnt live in our area, but still, cool guy. Elder Salas is a hard worker, so it was a good day. At night we went to go visit Richard and Gladys (back in our area). We got there and Richard said that they had just moved to a new house (which is, by the way, a huge blessing that they found a house). They still live in our area though. We got in his car and went with his family to the new house. On the way there, some dogs started barking at us, so their 3 yr old son Cris stuck his head out the window and started barking back.
<br><br>
Thursday- In the morning we had to do visa stuff. It really never ends. Then we did weekly planning. The afternoon was another rough one. It rained really hard too. We had one lesson and then at night ward counsel.
<br><br>
Friday- Another intercambio. This time I went with Elder Preslar from Morgan Utah. Just a great missionary. He only has like 8 months, but he's really good. We had a few lessons that day. I got a little frustrated at night cause we were teaching this lady that just... wasnt the best. She understood everything and knew we had something important. She just wouldnt give it a chance cause she was too Catholic. She said she literally couldnt meet with us again or something. Sometimes it is just sad that we give people the chance, but they are so set in their ways that they refuse to change.
<br><br>
Saturday- Back in my area again. We worked really hard, but there werent a ton of people home. It seems like the majority of the people in our area are a little crazy... so every conversion is a new experience. We did talk to one guy named Juan Jose that was decent. We'll see what happens. We did talk to Jhery at night. He's one of those converts that's really good, but he'll need support for a while. He's doing well for now though.
<br><br>
Sunday- Church was good. All the converts and less actives came, so that was good. Nora went too. After church was rough. We had a ton of appointments fall through and we were a little down. We talk to a bunch of people, but they usually fall through on the follow up visit. The hardest part is just getting in houses. However, at night we did contact a reference that was really cool. His name is Milton, but his friends call him Mufasa. He's really big and has a beard. Super cool guy though, loves his family, and has a lot of good questions. I was so relieved to teach him finally, and hopefully he'll progress.
<br><br>
So that was the week. This next week will be cool because we have a leadership conference with Elder Godoy of the 70. It should be a really busy week, but I'm excited. Love you guys
<br><br>
Elder Bagley
