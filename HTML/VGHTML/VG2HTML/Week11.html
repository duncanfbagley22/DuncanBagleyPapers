            <h1>Week 11 <small>(March 2, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>Mufasa</h3>
            <p><small>Okee doke family,<br>
    This was an interesting week. Good things happened, we got frustrated at times, and just all sorts of fun stuff. It's weird that we're into march now. I bunch of my mission buddies, like Elder Laidlaw for example, are going home in just one week. I remember meeting that group when they had like 4 months. Time just keeps flying. Cambios are this next week, so I'm a little nervous/anxious. If I stay, I'll end here, and if not I'll end in the next area. It's the cambio that'll decide my mission. I cant focus on that too much though. Anyways, this is what happened this week.
<br><br>
Monday- Pday at the mission home. It was really fun. We played games and basketball and stuff. Our zone is pretty cool. At night, we had a quick lesson with the Flia Porco and then we had an FHE with the 1st counselor in the stake presidency and his family. Super cool family. The parents are both RMs and the daughter just got back a week ago from her mission in Paraguay. They help a lot in the work. Awesome people.
<br><br>
Tuesday- It was just a regular day. We had district and zone meeting and then we went to the office. We had one lesson with a recent convert named Ivan. He was found knocking doors and the only reason he talked to the missionaries was cause he watched south park and heard about the church. Fun fact.
<br><br>
Wednesday- We did an intercambio. I went with Elder Salas from Peru/Sandy. Remember when Aunt Sherry told us about her stake president's adopted son that was going to my mission. Yup, that guy. I took a picture, dont worry. We had a good day. At night we contacted some really cool guy. Doesnt live in our area, but still, cool guy. Elder Salas is a hard worker, so it was a good day. At night we went to go visit Richard and Gladys (back in our area). We got there and Richard said that they had just moved to a new house (which is, by the way, a huge blessing that they found a house). They still live in our area though. We got in his car and went with his family to the new house. On the way there, some dogs started barking at us, so their 3 yr old son Cris stuck his head out the window and started barking back.
<br><br>
Thursday- In the morning we had to do visa stuff. It really never ends. Then we did weekly planning. The afternoon was another rough one. It rained really hard too. We had one lesson and then at night ward counsel.
<br><br>
Friday- Another intercambio. This time I went with Elder Preslar from Morgan Utah. Just a great missionary. He only has like 8 months, but he's really good. We had a few lessons that day. I got a little frustrated at night cause we were teaching this lady that just... wasnt the best. She understood everything and knew we had something important. She just wouldnt give it a chance cause she was too Catholic. She said she literally couldnt meet with us again or something. Sometimes it is just sad that we give people the chance, but they are so set in their ways that they refuse to change.
<br><br>
Saturday- Back in my area again. We worked really hard, but there werent a ton of people home. It seems like the majority of the people in our area are a little crazy... so every conversion is a new experience. We did talk to one guy named Juan Jose that was decent. We'll see what happens. We did talk to Jhery at night. He's one of those converts that's really good, but he'll need support for a while. He's doing well for now though.
<br><br>
Sunday- Church was good. All the converts and less actives came, so that was good. Nora went too. After church was rough. We had a ton of appointments fall through and we were a little down. We talk to a bunch of people, but they usually fall through on the follow up visit. The hardest part is just getting in houses. However, at night we did contact a reference that was really cool. His name is Milton, but his friends call him Mufasa. He's really big and has a beard. Super cool guy though, loves his family, and has a lot of good questions. I was so relieved to teach him finally, and hopefully he'll progress.
<br><br>
So that was the week. This next week will be cool because we have a leadership conference with Elder Godoy of the 70. It should be a really busy week, but I'm excited. Love you guys
<br><br>
Elder Bagley

                        <p>Tramites... not really super fun. I just talked to Elder Skousen the whole time, so it wasn't too bad. After that, we went to district meeting. I'm a pretty big fan of the zone now. I like everyone and things are going well. After that we went to lunch. We decided that going to the office earlier would be more effective, so we did. We hung around in the office for a bit, and then we went home. We had a few lessons fall through, which sucks. We did have one lesson with Ivan. He's a good kid, it's just hard when you're not in charge of your life. We worked hard trying to find people. We're getting a lot better. We had like 10 minutes left in the night and we workedd hard and found 2 people. Not the best day ever, but not too bad.</p>

                        <p>Yet another intercambio. We got up early today and went to Amancayas. I stayed there with Elder Salas. He's from Peru, but he lived in Utah for like 6 years. He was actually in my aunt and uncle's stake. We studied and all that, and then we went out. Before lunch, we just gave a blessing to some lady. Lunch was all right. The pensionista's son is the most malcriado ever. After that we went out and worked. We worked hard. Their area is huge, so it's a little complicated. We did teach a lesson to some cholita that gave us food. It wasn't the best food, so I hid it and threw it away later. We did teach one cool kid, Mauricio, who'll definitely be baptized one day. We also taught this lady who prayed for like 10 minutes straight. We did have one really cool contact, who basically told us that he felt the spirit talking to us. After we ended the intercambio, we taught Richard's family. The found a new house, that was awesome. So many obvious blessings for being active. So ya, overall good day.</p>

                        <p>Well today wasn't too interesting. In the morning we had tramites. Hansen went in and did his stuff, so I just stayed outside and talked to Elder Nielsen and Elder Campo. After tramites we just went homoe and planned a little. We had some rough luck in the afternoon. We couldn't really find much to do. We did talk to Ivan for a little bit. We almost talked to Julio Cesar, but he was with a friend, so he kinda shrugged us off. We had consejo at night. Not too bad but nothing super interesting. Honestly, that's what happened. Not really the most interesting day, but I'm a missionary, so life's good.</p>

                      <p>Intercambio #7 I think. Today I went with Elder Preslar from Morgan, Utah. He's a really great missionary. I met him his first day in the mission, and I was his "comp" for like a day. We also both started in Churuquella. After we studied, we went out and taught some people named Kendi and Cristian. They're nice, not super interested, but nice. Kendi likes to breastfeed out in the open, which is different. After that we talked to Nora. alittle. The afternoon was a little rough. We ended up with 2 lessons with some people that at the end of the lessons decided that the weren't interested. So uninterested that they hardly would accept the pamphlets. They understood everything, but being catholic stopped them from accepting anything. It got me really frustrated, just that they are so set in their ways that they won't accept anything else or even give it a chance. Sometimes Bolivia frustrates me. After we ended the intercambio, we contacted some guy in a taxi and got hit on by a gas station girl. Productive day I'd say.</p>

                    <p>February went quite fast. As for today, we got out and worked early. It was super hot in the morning. We did have one lesson with Marlon. He seems to be doing well, so hopefully he goes to church. Hansen got pooped on by a bird in the morning as well. After a huge lunch, we went out to work, but this time it was raining. We had a lesson with this guy named Juan Jose. Nice guy, a little different, but nice. We also had a lesson with Cesar and Lijia. They seem to be doing well, so hopefully they keep it up. We contacted a bunch as well today. To end the day we talked to Jhery. I really like him. We'll have to take care of him for a while, just to keep him active, but he's doing well right now. We talked about tithing. It was a rough day at some parts, but good enough.</p>

                    <p>Today was a rough one. Church was ok. We got Nora there. We also got to help Richard bless his baby, and Jhery was there again to bless the sacrament. The classes were just normal. After church and lunch, we went out to work. We had Hno Ferrufino with us most of the day. After a few hours, we had nothing. We had so many things fall through, me and Hansen just got frustrated. We just couldn't get anything. We did find one guy at the end, named Milton. He's a reference. Super cool guy, nicknamed Mufasa. I really see a lot of potential for progress, so hopefully he can progress. I'm super tired, so it's hard to write. Hasta tomorrow</p>

                    <p>Today was a really good day. A+ quality. The morning was good. We studied, then we went to the office to get headphones. After that we went to meet up with the zone to take a spanish test. While waiting we got contacted by this kid who wanted to learn about the church. We then went to take the test. It's terrible, I hate it, and I'll leave it at that. Then, us, Elder Tronson, Sharp, Preslar, and Tovar went to Fridays. From there me and Hansen went to go print pictures and buy stuff. Hoenstly, as weird as it is, the non p-day part of p-day was better. At 6 we had a lesson with the Flia Porco. We taught Ivan and Marco, and they have potential, especially Marco. After that we had an FHE with Cesar and Lijia. We ate Pique macho, watched a quick restoration movie, and we even met a new guy, Sebastian, that was a reference from them. Really solid p-day. Everything turned out great. I with everyday were like this.</p>
