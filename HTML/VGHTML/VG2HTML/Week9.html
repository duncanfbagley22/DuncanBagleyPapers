            <h1>Week 9 <small>(February 16, 2015)<i><small> *written February 18</small></i></small></h1>
            <h3>House Arrest</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
    This was quite the week and a half. Lots of things going on, intercambios, being home and not leaving for 2 days, and stuff like that. I'll just go through the days, which are pretty interesting I think. Here we go...
<br><br>
Monday- After writing, we had our zone activity. We did it combined with Elder Valerio and Elder Skousen's zone. Me and Elder Hansen made some sandwiches that turned out great. There were like 42 missionaries there, so it was a big job. We played capture the flag with water balloons, spray foam, and then we dipped our hands in paint so that when we'd touch the shirts it'd leave a mark. Creative right? Well, after 2 games, it started to rain super hard and instead of leaving with just paint and water, everyone was covered in mud. We all washed off and then the 4 of us decided to talk to president. Not cause we did anything thing bad, but we just wanted to make sure that wasnt anything misunderstandings. We went to the mission home and talked and president was just super cool about it, and in the end we just kinda hung out with president for a half hour. At night we had an FHE with Richard's family.
<br><br>
Tuesday- We had our district and zone meetings in the morning and then we had an intercambio. I stayed in our area and I went with Elder Olson from Arizona. He's got like a month left in the mission. He's super cool. I already knew him super well, so the intercambio was just really fun. We had a few lessons and I learned a lot from him. 
<br><br>
Wednesday- We ended the intercambio in the morning and then me and Elder Hansen got back to work. We had a few lesson. One with a less active lady that had a testimony but isnt interested in going back to church because she got offended. It's really frustrating when that happens.
<br><br>
Thursday- We went to the temple. It's always the best. One thing I did, a suggestion from my comp, was that I went with a specific question. Well, I got my specific answer. It's cool how much closer you feel to the Lord when you are in the temple. We took a bunch of pictures after and then on the way out, I saw my first ZL Elder Cusiatao. He is from Cusco and he was visiting the temple. That day we didnt find much. I did do a baptismal interview for the smartest 9yr old bolivian I've ever met. We had ward counsel at night and then we started another intercambio, this time with the elders in our ward. I went to the other area with Elder Torres from Peru. 
<br><br>
Friday- Intercambio #2. It was a busy day. We went to contact a lot of references and had some good lessons. The coolest part was when we were just walking down the street and some random guy came up and said that he had a reference for us. Well, we went with him quickly and contacted the reference. It'd be really easy to have success if that happened every day. It was a solid intercambio. At night, now with E Hansen, we just talked to Jhery and Veronica.
<br><br>
Saturday- We worked really hard that day. Coolest part was in the afternoon. The week before we had knocked a door and talked to this kid and set up an appointment. We called to confirm that morning and he was actually there (first miracle). Then we taught him the whole first lesson. As we ended, we helped his mom and older brother carry groceries in, and then we taught another lesson to the whole family. They're the Flia Porco, and we have a lot of hope for them. We had to be home early that night, so we just updated the area book and stuff.
<br><br>
Sunday- We had 0 investigators but we did have like 6 less actives there. After church we had to run over to talk to Jhery and Veronica to solve some things, and then we had lunch. We were able to find this guy named Jimmy later. He got a BoM a few years ago and was actually reading up until last Septemerish. He's a down to earth guy, and we hope he does well. We also talked to our evangelical pastor investigator, Ariel. He's read about half the BoM, but doesnt have an answer yet. You never know what can happen, especially since the church is true. 
<br><br>
Monday- Not super interesting. We stayed home all day. We cleaned the house, took a nap, studied a little... It wasnt all that interesting
<br><br>
Tuesday- Same as Monday. We stayed home, studied, did weekly planning, and we did have a little basketball game with the nerf hoop. At night we drank that peppermint cocoa thing you sent and it was amazing. 
<br><br>
So that's the week. We're busting our butts looking for people. Trying everything we can. We knock doors, talk in the street, visit members, and even deliver fruit and laihonas to less actives with the primary president. Galatas 6:9 We're planting lots of seeds, and just hoping to harvest some quickly. I love you guys, and I'll talk to you next week.

                        <p>Intercambio #2. The morning was all normal. We had district meeting in the morning and it was good and all that. After that we started our intercambio. E' Hansen went out to Sacaba and I stayed here with E' Olson from Arizona. I know him pretty well, and it was super fun. We had 2 lessons. First we talked to Marlon about going to church. I'm starting to want to give waska just to get him to go. After that we talked to Nora. Then we went to the offices. We hung out there for a bit and then we went back to the area. Our appt fell through, so we got dinner and went down to our WML house for the meeting. It was pretty good, Hno Rivero is still just super awesome. A quick day, but it was fun. Learning a lot from Olson.</p>

                        <p>Just a regular day. We finished the intercambio in the morning and then me and Elder Hansen went out to work. In the morning we talked to Lilian a little bit, just about how the gospel will help her. She has a lot of problems with her husband, so she just needs to accept the gospel, but she doesn't for some reason. We always take Hna Maria Quiroga, our pensionista, with us. She's really nice, but she gets off topic a lot. After lunch we took a bunch of Liahonas to the Flia Ferrufino for some project thing they wanna do. After that we talked to this less active lady named Senovia. You can tell she has some sort of testimony, but she got offended so she doesn't go. She's not really keen on talking to us. At night we talked to Andrea. She's a friend of Jhony that he borught to church. She's cool, just not super religious. It'll be a process to get her progress, but you never know what can happen. Today wasn't too bad, we got some good things done.</p>

                        <p>Woohoo, temple day!!! We got up at 4:30am and we got to the temple around 5:45am. It was great. E' Hansen told me to go looking for an answer to a question, and I did. I came out just thinking of the word sacrifice. That'll be my focus for the next little while. We took some pictures afterwards and I even saw Elder Cusiatao, my first ZL, who was visiting the temple. We then went home, did weekly planning, and then went out to work. We couldn't really find much to do. We only had a quick lesson with Felix, a less active. We had a few things fall through, but finally at night we had ward council. It was good at the beginning, but then they started talking about budget stuf for like 40min. Finally we just decided to leave. Now I'm in the other area on an intercambio with Elder Torres from Peru. Tomorrow will be fun. Honestly, not a huge fan of intercambios, but it's a good change of pace.</p>

                      <p>Intercambio #3. This is probably the hardest intercambio I'll have this transfer, but it really wasn't too bad. We got up, studied, and did all that. After that we went to contact a reference. We taught her a lesson and it went pretty well. We also looked at a house they want to move to. Then we talked to a less active lady. After lunch we went out again. We walked form end to end, but the lessons fell through. We did have one with this lady named Carmen. She's super ready for baptism, but she needs to get married first. Probably the coolest part of the day happened when we were just walking in the middle of nowhere and some guy came up to us and said he had a reference for us. We then went with him, contacted, and taught the reference. We ended the intercambio talking with the bishop and then we went to our house to end. We talked with Jhery and Veronica at night and it was good. Not a bad intercambio, but I'm glad it's over.<br><br></p>

                    <h3>February 14, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Woohoo, Valentines day. Means absolutely nothing as a missionary. Today was actually really good. We started with a lesson with Nora. We just went over the first lesson to see what she remembered, and she's better than we thought. Still a long ways to go. We also contacted the family that lives with her. After that, and lunch, we went and taught this kid named Ivan. We took Ivan, the member, with us. We taught all of the first lesson, and then his mom called and said she needed help with groceries. We went too, helped, and then when we got back to teh house, we sat down and taught the mom and older brother. Pretty awesome turn of events in 2 hours. They're the Flia Porco, and they have potential. After talking with them, we went down and taught Cedric. He's a less active kid. He's kinda weird, but he's a good kid. He said he knows the church is true, but he got offended so he doesn't go to church. We'll be working with him to show that if we really believe, we'll act on it. We had to be home at 7:30 because of carnval, but for a shortened day, today was really good.</p>

                    <h3>February 15, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Today was good... and bad. We got to church and we had 0 investigators there. Everyone fell through .We did have like 6 or 7 less actives there though. Me and Hansen gave talks. It was ok, but they didn't give us a ton of time. The rest of church was just regular. AFter we got home, we ran over to talk to Jhery and Veronica, cause Jhery didn't go to church. I think we definitely helped. Jhery gets mad, and because of that he doesn't go to church. We helped him understand that he really needs to go to church. In the afternoon we met this guy named Jimmy. Cool guy, understands, and hopefully is interested enough to progress. He'd talked with JWs before, and they drove by twice while we were talking. Probably not happy. We also talked to Ariel. He's read about half the BoM. Doesn't have an answer, but he's still going. Finally at night we talked to Marcelo and Alison, some less actives. They're moving in a few weeks, so we just talked about how it'll be a good place to start over and be active. Solid lesson. Tomorrow we'll be home all day, so shouldn't be too interesting.</p>

                    <p>So I don't usually join days, but I'm going to do it because really not that much happened. These 2 days were spent inside, all day. For carnaval we weren't allowed to leave, besides our pensionistas. We got a lot done though. The first day we cleaned the whole house. It wasn't too bad, it just took a while. The second day I cleaned my personal stuff. I also studied a bit We took naps both days, watched some mormon messages, and had good chats. At the pension, we just hung out and we never ended up getting wet. We also met Hna Quiroga's mom, who's kinda different. Nice, but different. We played some nerf basketball, cleaned more, did weekly planning etc. Tuesday night we drank some peppermint cocoa (best thing ever) and talked more. Honestly, I did enjoy getting a rest. I'll enjoy getting back to work, spring to the finish.</p>
