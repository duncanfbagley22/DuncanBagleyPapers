            <h1>Week 9 <small>(February 16, 2015)<i><small> *written February 18</small></i></small></h1>
            <h3>House Arrest</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
    This was quite the week and a half. Lots of things going on, intercambios, being home and not leaving for 2 days, and stuff like that. I'll just go through the days, which are pretty interesting I think. Here we go...
<br><br>
Monday- After writing, we had our zone activity. We did it combined with Elder Valerio and Elder Skousen's zone. Me and Elder Hansen made some sandwiches that turned out great. There were like 42 missionaries there, so it was a big job. We played capture the flag with water balloons, spray foam, and then we dipped our hands in paint so that when we'd touch the shirts it'd leave a mark. Creative right? Well, after 2 games, it started to rain super hard and instead of leaving with just paint and water, everyone was covered in mud. We all washed off and then the 4 of us decided to talk to president. Not cause we did anything thing bad, but we just wanted to make sure that wasnt anything misunderstandings. We went to the mission home and talked and president was just super cool about it, and in the end we just kinda hung out with president for a half hour. At night we had an FHE with Richard's family.
<br><br>
Tuesday- We had our district and zone meetings in the morning and then we had an intercambio. I stayed in our area and I went with Elder Olson from Arizona. He's got like a month left in the mission. He's super cool. I already knew him super well, so the intercambio was just really fun. We had a few lessons and I learned a lot from him. 
<br><br>
Wednesday- We ended the intercambio in the morning and then me and Elder Hansen got back to work. We had a few lesson. One with a less active lady that had a testimony but isnt interested in going back to church because she got offended. It's really frustrating when that happens.
<br><br>
Thursday- We went to the temple. It's always the best. One thing I did, a suggestion from my comp, was that I went with a specific question. Well, I got my specific answer. It's cool how much closer you feel to the Lord when you are in the temple. We took a bunch of pictures after and then on the way out, I saw my first ZL Elder Cusiatao. He is from Cusco and he was visiting the temple. That day we didnt find much. I did do a baptismal interview for the smartest 9yr old bolivian I've ever met. We had ward counsel at night and then we started another intercambio, this time with the elders in our ward. I went to the other area with Elder Torres from Peru. 
<br><br>
Friday- Intercambio #2. It was a busy day. We went to contact a lot of references and had some good lessons. The coolest part was when we were just walking down the street and some random guy came up and said that he had a reference for us. Well, we went with him quickly and contacted the reference. It'd be really easy to have success if that happened every day. It was a solid intercambio. At night, now with E Hansen, we just talked to Jhery and Veronica.
<br><br>
Saturday- We worked really hard that day. Coolest part was in the afternoon. The week before we had knocked a door and talked to this kid and set up an appointment. We called to confirm that morning and he was actually there (first miracle). Then we taught him the whole first lesson. As we ended, we helped his mom and older brother carry groceries in, and then we taught another lesson to the whole family. They're the Flia Porco, and we have a lot of hope for them. We had to be home early that night, so we just updated the area book and stuff.
<br><br>
Sunday- We had 0 investigators but we did have like 6 less actives there. After church we had to run over to talk to Jhery and Veronica to solve some things, and then we had lunch. We were able to find this guy named Jimmy later. He got a BoM a few years ago and was actually reading up until last Septemerish. He's a down to earth guy, and we hope he does well. We also talked to our evangelical pastor investigator, Ariel. He's read about half the BoM, but doesnt have an answer yet. You never know what can happen, especially since the church is true. 
<br><br>
Monday- Not super interesting. We stayed home all day. We cleaned the house, took a nap, studied a little... It wasnt all that interesting
<br><br>
Tuesday- Same as Monday. We stayed home, studied, did weekly planning, and we did have a little basketball game with the nerf hoop. At night we drank that peppermint cocoa thing you sent and it was amazing. 
<br><br>
So that's the week. We're busting our butts looking for people. Trying everything we can. We knock doors, talk in the street, visit members, and even deliver fruit and laihonas to less actives with the primary president. Galatas 6:9 We're planting lots of seeds, and just hoping to harvest some quickly. I love you guys, and I'll talk to you next week.
