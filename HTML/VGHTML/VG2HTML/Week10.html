            <h1>Week 10 <small>(February 23, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>I wouldve thought of a good title but the internet lady is kicking us out cause she's leaving</h3>
            <p><small>Good Morning,<br>
    This was a busy week. Actually, the first 2 days werent too busy, cause we were inside all day. I already explained that on Wednesday though. We didnt work a ton this week, as we had to stay inside, then we had a day full of meetings, then zone conference. 2 of the 3 days we did work, I was in a different area for intercambios. On Sunday when I finally got to work in our area, it felt weird, like I was visiting after a long time. I'm glad to be back now, just normal. That's my feelings on this week, now here's what happened...
<br><br>
Wednesday- After I wrote you, we had district meeting. Elder Hansen and I didnt go to class, instead we just pulled all the companionships out one by one and talked to them about their areas and stuff like that. I hope that it helped them, at least it helped us. After that we shared a little class. Good moment of the day. So there's an elder that has had some unkind feelings towards me for the last year. Now, you probably are asking yourself 2 things. 1) Who? 2) How could anyone not like elder Bagley? (that second question makes me sound really humble). Anyways, this elder is in our zone and came up to me after zone meeting and said sorry for that and that he'd gotten over it (I didnt actually do anything, he just thought that I did something I didnt). So now no one hates me. WOOHOO!!! I was happy that happened. After the meeting we went to the offices, then we had a meeting with Pres Hansen and the stake president, to talk about the missionaries and the wards and see how to get better. We had dinner, and just barely enough time to go talk to a recent convert.
<br><br>
Thursday- Intercambio number 1. I went to barrio Frutillar (next to ours) and went with Elder Morales. He is from Argentina and has the greatest voice in the world. He literally sounds like an announcer or something like that. He was in El Paso as well, so we talked about that area and the people there a lot. I had a good time. We taught a few lessons, carried water from a well to some old lady's house, and even bought some sandwiches to contact this lady. It was good to get to know Elder Morales and learn from him. Solid intercambio
<br><br>
Friday- We had zone conference. It was really good. We learned about how to be a consecrated missionary (there's a talk by Elder Callister about that subject) and that was cool. We also learned how to contact people in the street better. When the assistants called on people to do the practice, and then needed someone to be the person in the street, I was 90% sure they would just call on me to do it... and they did. I nailed my part, if all my other plans dont work, I think I'll just go into acting. I do a Bolivian impression very well. After lunch we got to watch the Meet the Mormons movie, in spanish. It was still good though. Only the missionaries are allowed to watch it for now, cause they might put it in theaters in South America. I was sitting next to Elder Valerio during the movie, and the part where they show the kid leaving from the Salt Lake airport made us have some flashbacks. Really good conference overall. At night we only really had time to talk to Jhery and Veronica a little, and then we knocked a few doors. I ripped my pants while climbing up a hill, making that 3 pairs that currently have holes in them... That night, we started yet another intercambio
<br><br>
Saturday- Intercambio number 2. I went with Elder Mickle, the AP. He lived with me my first transfer in Sucre, so I know him pretty well. I went back to Villa Moscu. 2nd time I've done that. I had a really good time with Elder Mickle. I learned a whole lot from him. He was contacting every person he could see. We met some cool people and worked hard. I also got a lot of advice from him on how to be a better leader. Also, it's always cool to be blocks away from the temple. 
<br><br>
Sunday- I finally got to sleep in my own bed Saturday night, after 2 days of travelling to other areas. We only had Nora at church, but we did get Jhery there and he blessed the sacrament for the first time. After church we couldnt find much to do. We did have a lesson with Ariel, our evangelical pastor investigator. He's actually doing well. Really, every time I leave his house after talking to him, I just have a stronger testimony about how this is the only true church. He asks a lot of questions, and the answers we give just confirm the truth to me. We contacted a lot of people in the street and at doors, following what the APs taught us, and it is working. We just have to talk to everyone we can.
<br><br>
Monday- We are going to the mission home for a BBQ today with the zone, should be fun. 
<br><br>
So ya, that's what happened. It's weird how fast the transfer is going. I was talking to Elder Laidlaw yesterday, and I realized that he is going to be going home in like 2 and half weeks. Elder Hansen gave his final public mission testimony at the zone conference. I'm glad I still have some time left. Sometimes the work is hard, but it's a good thing the church is true, so it makes it worth it. I found a cool scripture today in 1 John 2:6:
<br><br>
"He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk,
even as he walked."
<br><br>
I'm realizing that the last short books in the bible, like 1 John and James, have some really good scriptures. Anyways, I hope you have a great week. Love you, talk to you next week.
<br><br>
Elder Bagley

                        <p>So I don't usually join days, but I'm going to do it because really not that much happened. These 2 days were spent inside, all day. For carnaval we weren't allowed to leave, besides our pensionistas. We got a lot done though. The first day we cleaned the whole house. It wasn't too bad, it just took a while. The second day I cleaned my personal stuff. I also studied a bit We took naps both days, watched some mormon messages, and had good chats. At the pension, we just hung out and we never ended up getting wet. We also met Hna Quiroga's mom, who's kinda different. Nice, but different. We played some nerf basketball, cleaned more, did weekly planning etc. Tuesday night we drank some peppermint cocoa (best thing ever) and talked more. Honestly, I did enjoy getting a rest. I'll enjoy getting back to work, spring to the finish.</p>

                        <p>P-morning... well, since we weren't able to go out Monday or Tuesday, we were given the morning today to do the regular p-day stuff. We really only did e-mail, but it was good. After that, we had our district/zone meeting. Me and Hansen took all the companionships one by one to talk about their areas and wards. Pretty good idea on our part after the zone meeting Elder Hernandez told me sorry and that he didn't hate me anymore. Big win, now I've got the whole zone on my side. After lunch, we worked for like a half hour, and then we went to the offices. It's always fun to be in the offices. After that, we had another meeting, this time with Pres Hansen and the stake president. We just talked about ways to help the work in the stake. It went well. Finally at night we talked to Kevin a little bit, just to help him. He's all right, but needs to get stronger in the church. Tomorrow weill be another intercambio, oh joy.</p>

                        <p>So today I completed 20 months. That's kinda cool. The morning was pretty normal. From 11-12 we worked outside in a blazing hot sun. We couldn't find anything. However, at 12 we met some somewhat decent new lady named Pastora. We also had a quick little lesson with Nora, just to see how she was. After lunch we went to Frutillar to start an intercambio. I went with Elder Morales from Argentina. He's a good kid, hard worker, and has the voice of an announcer. We worked really hard and got a few good things done. We contacted a few people, who taught a lady after buying a sandwich from her. We also brought water up from a well to some old lady. At night, we taught this family, the Flia Flores. Super cool family, definitely should be baptized soon. Overall, it was a good day. I'm starting to like intercambios a little bit, it's a good learning opportunity.</p>

                      <p>Conference day. We woke up normal, then Hansen and Garcia (we were still on intercambio) came by and picked us up. From the Frutillar house we went to the zone conference. It was a solid conference. We learned a little about being a consecrated missionary, how to contact in the street, and stuff like that. In the street contacting part, I had to be the investigator. I played my part very well. We also heard some final testimonies, including Elder Hansen's. It was weird to see people that have 1 transfer more than me giving their final testimony. We ate lunch and then we watched the "Meet the Mormons". After the conference we picked up our laundry, then we went up to the house. We had a good solid lesson with Jhery and Veronica about responsabilities and stuff. It went well. At night while waiting for the APs to get there to start an intercambio, I ripped my pants. I'm in Villa Moscu again for an intercambio. AP for a day, part 2.</p>

                    <p>Intercambio! Today I went with E' Mickle in Villa Moscu today. I lived with him my first transfer, so it was kind of a throwback day. It was really fun. We had a good time. I really learned how to contact better with him. He talked to everyone and their dog. Obviously, not everyone was interested, but you can find good people. He exemplified the idea of "talk with everyone". We had a chance to talk a lot and I got a lot of advice from him. It's cool to see the difference from last August until now, how much he's changed. He's Richard G Scott's grandson too, so he has cool stories. We ended the intercambio in Villa Moscu, then me and Hansen went back to our area. First time in my house in like 2 1/2 days. I think we both left the intercambio very edified, and we're ready to put everything to use.</p>

                    <p> rough day, but we got some good things at church. Best part, we got Jhery to go to church. He blessed the sacrament for the first time. Sometimes recent converts require a lot of effort, but the results are worth it. Apart from that, nothing cool really happened. After church, and lunch, we went out to work. We didn't really find much for much of the afternoon, but we did have a lesson with Arielle. Every time we teach him, my testimony grows a lot. He asks great questions, but the gospel answers them perfectly. Maybe he'll progress one day. We then worked with Alvaro. We had a lot of things fall through. Alvaro is a stud though, so it was all good. To end the night we did find this kid Victor Hugo, who seemed interested. Really, we always seem to find something to end the day. We gotta work to the end I guess.</p>

                    <p>P-day, actually a really good one. We had internet cut short in the morning just cause the owner had to close up to go pick up her kids. After that, we went to the mission home, where we had p-day. The whole zone went, and it turned out great. We ate hamburgers, played games, played ping-pong, and basketball, and just had a good time. It rained all day. One of the better p-days we've had. After the activity we just went home and slept till 6, cause I had a headache. At 6 we talked to the Flia Porco. It was good, but we need to get the members involved. We also had an FHE with the Flia Valle, the 1st counselor in the stake presidency. His daughter just got back from a mission a week ago. Awesome family, good missionaries. We'll be working with them more. Honestly, today was nearly perfect.</p>
