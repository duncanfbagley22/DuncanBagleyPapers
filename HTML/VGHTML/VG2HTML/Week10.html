            <h1>Week 10 <small>(February 23, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>I wouldve thought of a good title but the internet lady is kicking us out cause she's leaving</h3>
            <p><small>Good Morning,<br>
    This was a busy week. Actually, the first 2 days werent too busy, cause we were inside all day. I already explained that on Wednesday though. We didnt work a ton this week, as we had to stay inside, then we had a day full of meetings, then zone conference. 2 of the 3 days we did work, I was in a different area for intercambios. On Sunday when I finally got to work in our area, it felt weird, like I was visiting after a long time. I'm glad to be back now, just normal. That's my feelings on this week, now here's what happened...
<br><br>
Wednesday- After I wrote you, we had district meeting. Elder Hansen and I didnt go to class, instead we just pulled all the companionships out one by one and talked to them about their areas and stuff like that. I hope that it helped them, at least it helped us. After that we shared a little class. Good moment of the day. So there's an elder that has had some unkind feelings towards me for the last year. Now, you probably are asking yourself 2 things. 1) Who? 2) How could anyone not like elder Bagley? (that second question makes me sound really humble). Anyways, this elder is in our zone and came up to me after zone meeting and said sorry for that and that he'd gotten over it (I didnt actually do anything, he just thought that I did something I didnt). So now no one hates me. WOOHOO!!! I was happy that happened. After the meeting we went to the offices, then we had a meeting with Pres Hansen and the stake president, to talk about the missionaries and the wards and see how to get better. We had dinner, and just barely enough time to go talk to a recent convert.
<br><br>
Thursday- Intercambio number 1. I went to barrio Frutillar (next to ours) and went with Elder Morales. He is from Argentina and has the greatest voice in the world. He literally sounds like an announcer or something like that. He was in El Paso as well, so we talked about that area and the people there a lot. I had a good time. We taught a few lessons, carried water from a well to some old lady's house, and even bought some sandwiches to contact this lady. It was good to get to know Elder Morales and learn from him. Solid intercambio
<br><br>
Friday- We had zone conference. It was really good. We learned about how to be a consecrated missionary (there's a talk by Elder Callister about that subject) and that was cool. We also learned how to contact people in the street better. When the assistants called on people to do the practice, and then needed someone to be the person in the street, I was 90% sure they would just call on me to do it... and they did. I nailed my part, if all my other plans dont work, I think I'll just go into acting. I do a Bolivian impression very well. After lunch we got to watch the Meet the Mormons movie, in spanish. It was still good though. Only the missionaries are allowed to watch it for now, cause they might put it in theaters in South America. I was sitting next to Elder Valerio during the movie, and the part where they show the kid leaving from the Salt Lake airport made us have some flashbacks. Really good conference overall. At night we only really had time to talk to Jhery and Veronica a little, and then we knocked a few doors. I ripped my pants while climbing up a hill, making that 3 pairs that currently have holes in them... That night, we started yet another intercambio
<br><br>
Saturday- Intercambio number 2. I went with Elder Mickle, the AP. He lived with me my first transfer in Sucre, so I know him pretty well. I went back to Villa Moscu. 2nd time I've done that. I had a really good time with Elder Mickle. I learned a whole lot from him. He was contacting every person he could see. We met some cool people and worked hard. I also got a lot of advice from him on how to be a better leader. Also, it's always cool to be blocks away from the temple. 
<br><br>
Sunday- I finally got to sleep in my own bed Saturday night, after 2 days of travelling to other areas. We only had Nora at church, but we did get Jhery there and he blessed the sacrament for the first time. After church we couldnt find much to do. We did have a lesson with Ariel, our evangelical pastor investigator. He's actually doing well. Really, every time I leave his house after talking to him, I just have a stronger testimony about how this is the only true church. He asks a lot of questions, and the answers we give just confirm the truth to me. We contacted a lot of people in the street and at doors, following what the APs taught us, and it is working. We just have to talk to everyone we can.
<br><br>
Monday- We are going to the mission home for a BBQ today with the zone, should be fun. 
<br><br>
So ya, that's what happened. It's weird how fast the transfer is going. I was talking to Elder Laidlaw yesterday, and I realized that he is going to be going home in like 2 and half weeks. Elder Hansen gave his final public mission testimony at the zone conference. I'm glad I still have some time left. Sometimes the work is hard, but it's a good thing the church is true, so it makes it worth it. I found a cool scripture today in 1 John 2:6:
<br><br>
"He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk,
even as he walked."
<br><br>
I'm realizing that the last short books in the bible, like 1 John and James, have some really good scriptures. Anyways, I hope you have a great week. Love you, talk to you next week.
<br><br>
Elder Bagley
