            <h1>Week 8 <small>(February 9, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>Trabajando...o...o</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Fambam,<br>
     This was an interesting week. We had a whole bunch of interesting things happen. It was good to finally just be with Elder Hansen for the week. He's a solid companion and we get along really well. He's as much of a sports nut as I am, so the days are full of constant sports references. It's fun. We also started a workout program this week called T-25. Getting up and exercising is always a challenge for me, but this last week I did really well. I'll come home in good shape (fingers crossed). The office kinda took a toll on me, as far as eating unhealthy, but I'm getting better. Anyways, this is what happened on all the days.
<br><br>
Monday- At night we had an FHE with the WML's family and Jhery and Veronica. It's always fun to be there, cause the WML's family is just awesome, and Jhery and Veronica are just awesome, so it's always just... awesome. Also, I helped Jhery send an email to the elder that first contacted them like a year ago or more. He was my first ZL, so I had his email. We sent him a picture of him baptizing his daughter. Probably the best email that an elder could ever get.
<br><br>
Tuesday- It was just a regular day. We talked to a few of the investigators and at night we talked to Lijia. She is a less active but she is super cool. Her husband, also less active, is a dweeb, but we're working with them. We couldnt find them for like 4 weeks, so it was good to get contact again. She really wants to be active, so we are just helping her to get there. 
<br><br>
Wednesday- We had the consejo de lideres. It's always fun to see all my mission buddies in one place. We talked about a lot of things. The APs gave a great lesson about working with members and applied it to the story of Ammon and King Lamoni. Really cool. It's great to be in the presence of so many good missionaries there. I always like consejo. At the end we took some pictures with people from my old zone, and then all the missionaries that go home the same time as me. At night we were supposed to have a lesson with a dude named Jose Manuel, but he fell through. We ended up just staying at the ward activity (somewhat poorly planned) and then going home. 
<br><br>
Thursday- Oh Thursday. In the morning we had to go do tramites. Hopefully by next week I can be legal again. Tramites just take forever. After finishing that we went home and then to lunch. The afternoon was rough. We had all of our appointments fall through, so we just contacted. All day. We talked to so many people, all over the area. We need more investigators, so we decided to try that. It kinda worked. It was super tiring though, and contacting gets old really fast. We did have ward council at night, and that was good. The bishop is just awesome, and they just told us during the council that if we ever need anything, we just ask them. Awesome ward.
<br><br>
Friday- In the morning we had zone meeting. Me and Elder Hansen just had to repeat all the things that we learned in the consejo de lideres. It was pretty solid. I like the zone, so it was good. I like teaching missionaries, so I never have a problem in the meetings. After that we started an intercambio. Elder Hansen went to his old area (from like a year ago) with Elder Hernandez (my old comp). I stayed in our area and went with Elder Prescott from California. He's probably one of the funniest missionaries I've ever met. It was super fun to work with him and we had some good success. We found a new investigator named Victor that we'll follow up on this week and taught this kid named Julio Cesar who could really progress. We enjoyed ourselves a lot and took some funny pictures with sheep. At night we talked to Richard and Gladys. Fun day
<br><br>
Saturday- In the morning we had to go move some stuff out of a house where missionaries used to live. We loaded up the truck and me and 2 other elders road in the back of the truck. It was probably pretty dangerous (sorry mom), but it was fun. In the afternoon we talked to Marlon and then we to visit the Flia Ferrufino. They are the 2nd counselor in the bishopric and the primary president. Super cool people and they gave us about 20 references of less actives and old investigators that we didnt know about. Very productive. It rained really hard that day as well. It was a productive day.
<br><br>
Sunday- Church was good. Nora showed up like 20 minutes early. She progresses kinda slow, but now she's a solid church goer. We'll see where that goes. Marlon didnt show up cause we think he went to play basketball (facepalm). His girlfriend Jhanet went though, so that was good. After church we had a few lessons with less actives. Best part of the day. We were walking up the street and heard some dude tell his daughter that we were called elderes. We went over and contacted him and found out that he was an investigator like 7 years ago and his cousin is a bishop. We set up an appointment with him and at that very moment, some other guy we didnt know called us over and said that he knew the elders in Santa Cruz. He's a police officer, so it's hard for him to talk to us freely (Bolivia's government is a different), but we talked for a bit and gave him a BoM. I love when investigators contact us. At night we just talked to Jhery and Veronica, which is always solid.
<br><br>
So there's the week. It was decent. Thursday was a bit rough, but this week looks more promising. The title comes from a song. Enrique Iglesias has this new song called "bailando" or something like that. Go listen to it and the title makes a little more sense. Anyways, love you guys a ton. FYI, carnaval is next monday and tuesday and we have to stay inside all day, so I'll be writing on WEDNESDAY. Love you<br>
Elder Bagley

                        <p>Pretty decent day. I got up and I was super sore from the exercises yesterday. However, we did more exercises, so I'm still sore. We did really well in the morning. We got 2 lessons with Lilian and then with Nora. With Lilian we just focused on her trying to receive her answer. With Nora we just talked about the Book of Mormon. After lunch we had a few things fall through, but we did end up talking to Marlon and Jhanet for a little bit. They've shown a little bit of progress, so there's hope. After that, and running into an annoying Atheist, we went to teh office to do finances. We spent time there, and then to end the night we talked with Lijia. She's cool, her husband is a bit of a loser. Tomorrow's consejo, so it should be fun.</p>

                        <p>Consejo day. The morning was all normal. After studies we went to the plaza Colon and got our shoes shined. After that we went to the consejo. It was pretty good. Personally, I liked the last consejo a little more, but this one was good. I always like to see all my friends. We learned a little about the doctrine of Christ, baptismal invitations, and how to work with the members. Consejos are fun because you see all the other missionaries there have the same goals in mind. After the consejo we took a few pictures and then we went back to the area. We were supposed to have an appt, but it fell through. We then just went to the chapel for a ward activity. I was a little discouraged at night, but oh well, I'll continue on.</p>

                        <p>Well, today sucked. In the morning we went to do tramites. We just waited in line forever. I talked to E' Kenney, E' Long, and E' Skousen. They told us to be quiet a bunch, but it passed the time. It took a long time, but we finally finished right before lunch. After lunch we worked, and worked, and worked. We had a goal to contact 15 people. We did that, visited some other people, but we didn't have a single lesson. It's a very rough thing to have happen, but it's a learning experience. I can feel good, cause we really did work hard. At night we had consejo, which was just regular. Hopefully tomorrow will be a bit better.</p>

                      <h3>February 6, 2015</h3>
                      <p>Today was pretty fun. In the morning we had our zone meeting. Me and Elder Hansen basically just had to re-teach everything that we learned in the consejo. I like teaching missionaries, so I enjoyed it. We have a good bunch of missionaries. After the meeting we started an intercambio. Hansen went down to Arocahua and I stayed here with E' Prescott. Great elder, and super fun to be with. We started the day meeting a guy named Victor. We met him by accident, but he seems good. After that we finally tlaked ot Julio Cesar. He's solid, we just need to keep contat. At night we talked to Richard and Gladys. They're always great. It really was a fun day with E' Prescott. He teaches well and is a super happy guy. I learned a lot from him. Today was way better than yesterday.</p>

                    <p>Today wasn't too bad either. In the morning we ended the intercambio and then we went out to Esmeralda. We had to move things out of a closed area. After loading up the truck, me, E' Meadows, and E' Garcia climbed in the back and headed to the center. Not super safe, but we made it. After that, and lunch, we went out to work. We had a bunch of things fall through, but we did teach Marlon and Jhanet about the tree of life. I drew it out and it looked great. After that we went and talked to the Flia Ferrufino. They're the 2nd counselor and primary pres. We were there for a while, but we got like 20 references for less actives and investigators. Productive appt. At night we met some kid named Ivan, who listened and seemed cool. Not a great day, but not terrible.</p>

                    <h3>February 8, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Sunday #? Today was ok I guess. We had 2 people at church. Nora showed up like 20min early, but she stayed the whole time. Also, Jhony brought a friend. Marlon didn't show up, but Jhanet did. After church and lunch, we had a few lessons. We talked to Kevin for a little bit, and then we went to a less active named Cedric. Good kid, will try to get him active. At that moment, something cool happened. We were talking and we heard some guy say "elderes". We didn't recognize him, so we talked. While talking, some other dude called us over. This guy was a police officer. We talked for a bit (he knew missionaries before) and left a BoM. That was probably the best moment of the day. We still don't have a ton of success, but we are working.<br><br>Wrote this while I was super tired</p>

                    <h3>February 9, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Today was crazy. We got up and headed down to Hipermaxi to meet up with E' Valerio and E' Skousen. We bought a bunch of stuff for the 2 zones to be able to make sandwiches. After that we went to their house to make sandwich sandwiches and fill up balloons. We stayed there for a while until around 10:30 we went down and did internet. We're all 4 officially living together (Laidlaw, Valerio, Skousen) so that'll be fun. After internet we went to the Alalay chapel and had lunch with the 2 zones. The sandwiches turned out great. Me and Skousen explained our game (capture the flag with water balloons and paint) and then we head over. It was better than planned. The game was awesome. We won once, and then once. Right before the 3rd game, it started to rain hard and everything got muddy. It was crazy there for a bit. We ended, got everyone clean, and then got ourselves cleaned up. We decided to talk to President out what happened (mud fight and stuff) just to avoid any misunderstandings. We went over, he wasn't mad at all, and honestly we just chilled with him for a bit. At night we had FHE with Richard's family. Ultimately, I feel pretty good. People said that it was there best P-day ever.</p>
