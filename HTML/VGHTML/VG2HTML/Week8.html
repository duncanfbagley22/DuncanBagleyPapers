            <h1>Week 8 <small>(February 9, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>Trabajando...o...o</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Fambam,<br>
     This was an interesting week. We had a whole bunch of interesting things happen. It was good to finally just be with Elder Hansen for the week. He's a solid companion and we get along really well. He's as much of a sports nut as I am, so the days are full of constant sports references. It's fun. We also started a workout program this week called T-25. Getting up and exercising is always a challenge for me, but this last week I did really well. I'll come home in good shape (fingers crossed). The office kinda took a toll on me, as far as eating unhealthy, but I'm getting better. Anyways, this is what happened on all the days.
<br><br>
Monday- At night we had an FHE with the WML's family and Jhery and Veronica. It's always fun to be there, cause the WML's family is just awesome, and Jhery and Veronica are just awesome, so it's always just... awesome. Also, I helped Jhery send an email to the elder that first contacted them like a year ago or more. He was my first ZL, so I had his email. We sent him a picture of him baptizing his daughter. Probably the best email that an elder could ever get.
<br><br>
Tuesday- It was just a regular day. We talked to a few of the investigators and at night we talked to Lijia. She is a less active but she is super cool. Her husband, also less active, is a dweeb, but we're working with them. We couldnt find them for like 4 weeks, so it was good to get contact again. She really wants to be active, so we are just helping her to get there. 
<br><br>
Wednesday- We had the consejo de lideres. It's always fun to see all my mission buddies in one place. We talked about a lot of things. The APs gave a great lesson about working with members and applied it to the story of Ammon and King Lamoni. Really cool. It's great to be in the presence of so many good missionaries there. I always like consejo. At the end we took some pictures with people from my old zone, and then all the missionaries that go home the same time as me. At night we were supposed to have a lesson with a dude named Jose Manuel, but he fell through. We ended up just staying at the ward activity (somewhat poorly planned) and then going home. 
<br><br>
Thursday- Oh Thursday. In the morning we had to go do tramites. Hopefully by next week I can be legal again. Tramites just take forever. After finishing that we went home and then to lunch. The afternoon was rough. We had all of our appointments fall through, so we just contacted. All day. We talked to so many people, all over the area. We need more investigators, so we decided to try that. It kinda worked. It was super tiring though, and contacting gets old really fast. We did have ward council at night, and that was good. The bishop is just awesome, and they just told us during the council that if we ever need anything, we just ask them. Awesome ward.
<br><br>
Friday- In the morning we had zone meeting. Me and Elder Hansen just had to repeat all the things that we learned in the consejo de lideres. It was pretty solid. I like the zone, so it was good. I like teaching missionaries, so I never have a problem in the meetings. After that we started an intercambio. Elder Hansen went to his old area (from like a year ago) with Elder Hernandez (my old comp). I stayed in our area and went with Elder Prescott from California. He's probably one of the funniest missionaries I've ever met. It was super fun to work with him and we had some good success. We found a new investigator named Victor that we'll follow up on this week and taught this kid named Julio Cesar who could really progress. We enjoyed ourselves a lot and took some funny pictures with sheep. At night we talked to Richard and Gladys. Fun day
<br><br>
Saturday- In the morning we had to go move some stuff out of a house where missionaries used to live. We loaded up the truck and me and 2 other elders road in the back of the truck. It was probably pretty dangerous (sorry mom), but it was fun. In the afternoon we talked to Marlon and then we to visit the Flia Ferrufino. They are the 2nd counselor in the bishopric and the primary president. Super cool people and they gave us about 20 references of less actives and old investigators that we didnt know about. Very productive. It rained really hard that day as well. It was a productive day.
<br><br>
Sunday- Church was good. Nora showed up like 20 minutes early. She progresses kinda slow, but now she's a solid church goer. We'll see where that goes. Marlon didnt show up cause we think he went to play basketball (facepalm). His girlfriend Jhanet went though, so that was good. After church we had a few lessons with less actives. Best part of the day. We were walking up the street and heard some dude tell his daughter that we were called elderes. We went over and contacted him and found out that he was an investigator like 7 years ago and his cousin is a bishop. We set up an appointment with him and at that very moment, some other guy we didnt know called us over and said that he knew the elders in Santa Cruz. He's a police officer, so it's hard for him to talk to us freely (Bolivia's government is a different), but we talked for a bit and gave him a BoM. I love when investigators contact us. At night we just talked to Jhery and Veronica, which is always solid.
<br><br>
So there's the week. It was decent. Thursday was a bit rough, but this week looks more promising. The title comes from a song. Enrique Iglesias has this new song called "bailando" or something like that. Go listen to it and the title makes a little more sense. Anyways, love you guys a ton. FYI, carnaval is next monday and tuesday and we have to stay inside all day, so I'll be writing on WEDNESDAY. Love you<br>
Elder Bagley
