            <h3>Nerves of Steel</h3>
            <p><small>Dear everyone,<br>
   This was just a great week. I title the email "nerves of steel" because this week was transfers. Whenever there're transfers, I get so nervous. Honestly, I dont have nerves of steel, I just get so darn nervous. No need to fear though, because me and Hansen are staying together. Hansen goes home after this transfer, so I should be ending my mission here as well. I'm glad, I just love the people here and the ward. It'll feel like a home ward pretty soon. Anyways, it really was a great week, and this is why.
<br><br>
Monday- After a low key p day, we had 2 great lessons at night. We taught the Flia Porco first. Really cool and have good potential. The oldest son Marco is especially good. At night we had an FHE with Cesar and Lijia, some less actives. They're doing better as of late. Cesar's mom is an old Quechua lady, and I really enjoy speaking Quechua with old women. They were supposed to bring a friend to the FHE, but he couldnt come, so they brought his brother, Sebastian, instead. We watched a restoration video and it was an overall productive day. 
<br><br>
Tuesday- We had zone meeting and all that. I'm going to miss a lot of the zone, it's been a fun transfer. Afterwards we went to the office, and then squeeked in a lesson in the time we had. We met this girl named Camila, and she's... interesting. She's a member of the Cristo Viene church. It was started by some RM guy a while back, and they're crazy. They scream and stuff and right now they're building their own New Zion down in Southern Bolivia. We explained the restoration to her and hopefully she'll figure things out.
<br><br>
Wednesday- I went on an intercambio with Elder Meadows from Jackson Hole, Wyoming. His family owns some hotels there, so next time we go we can get a deal. He's awesome. He goes home in april, and has already been ZL and DL twice. I've known him since Sucre, so we get along really well. We went to his area. We had a solid day, and met this less active guy's wife who's great. She already seems like a member, so I hope they can get her somewhere.
<br><br>
Thursday- We went to do visa work in the morning, and I'm legal now. Shouldnt have to do visa work ever again. In the afternoon, we taught that Sebastian guy from monday. Elder Hansen taught him on Wednesday as well. We didnt have really any hope for him, but he's great. He prayed and said that he just knows that Joseph Smith is a prophet. He does great in the lessons and is interested. Just goes to show that anyone can get a testimony if they want to. We have really high hopes for him. 
<br><br>
Friday- We worked just in the morning, because in the afternoon we had a conference with Elder Godoy of the 70. He's awesome, and really funny. He constantly spoke a mix of Spanish, English, and Portuguese. He spoke on a lot of great things and I learned a ton. Awesome conference. At night we went to the Hospital, because Veronica was there. She had some complications cause I guess she's pregnant. I think it really made her happy that we visited her.
<br><br>
Saturday- Another intercambio. I went in our area with Elder Tovar from Peru. He has like 2 months, which was a change from Elder Hansen who has 22. We had a really good day though. The best lesson was with Marco Porco. He understood everything really well and seems ready. We put a baptismal date and hopefully he can keep going well. He has all the desires and I am just really glad to teach him. We also met a few other people, I picked cactus fruit from a cactus, and we just worked hard. I feel the pressure to do everything well on intercambios, so I can be an example. It was just a great day all together. 
<br><br>
Sunday- We had 3 missionaries that are going home monday, Elder Grigor, Laidlaw, and Howlett, visiting. It was weird to see them like that, just cause I remember when they had 4 months. All 3 great missionaries though. In the afternoon we had some good lessons. We talked to Richard's family, and they are still great. Their kid Chris is just the funniest kid ever. We also met the Flia Perez. The dad is a less active, and the mom isnt a member. They have 2 of the cutest little daughters ever. It might be a long process to get them going, but they'd be a great family. Missionaries have been trying for a while, but none since they saw a miracle and their niece's life was saved. Hopefully it's time. 
<br><br>
Monday- We're having a Cobija zone reunion and a bbq. I'll also probably say bye to Laidlaw until next fall. I'm really glad I'm staying here. It'll be a fun way to end. I know me and Hansen will work hard. Love you guys so much, and have a good week.
