            <h1>Week 12 <small>(March 9, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>Nerves of Steel</h3>
            <p><small>Dear everyone,<br>
   This was just a great week. I title the email "nerves of steel" because this week was transfers. Whenever there're transfers, I get so nervous. Honestly, I dont have nerves of steel, I just get so darn nervous. No need to fear though, because me and Hansen are staying together. Hansen goes home after this transfer, so I should be ending my mission here as well. I'm glad, I just love the people here and the ward. It'll feel like a home ward pretty soon. Anyways, it really was a great week, and this is why.
<br><br>
Monday- After a low key p day, we had 2 great lessons at night. We taught the Flia Porco first. Really cool and have good potential. The oldest son Marco is especially good. At night we had an FHE with Cesar and Lijia, some less actives. They're doing better as of late. Cesar's mom is an old Quechua lady, and I really enjoy speaking Quechua with old women. They were supposed to bring a friend to the FHE, but he couldnt come, so they brought his brother, Sebastian, instead. We watched a restoration video and it was an overall productive day. 
<br><br>
Tuesday- We had zone meeting and all that. I'm going to miss a lot of the zone, it's been a fun transfer. Afterwards we went to the office, and then squeeked in a lesson in the time we had. We met this girl named Camila, and she's... interesting. She's a member of the Cristo Viene church. It was started by some RM guy a while back, and they're crazy. They scream and stuff and right now they're building their own New Zion down in Southern Bolivia. We explained the restoration to her and hopefully she'll figure things out.
<br><br>
Wednesday- I went on an intercambio with Elder Meadows from Jackson Hole, Wyoming. His family owns some hotels there, so next time we go we can get a deal. He's awesome. He goes home in april, and has already been ZL and DL twice. I've known him since Sucre, so we get along really well. We went to his area. We had a solid day, and met this less active guy's wife who's great. She already seems like a member, so I hope they can get her somewhere.
<br><br>
Thursday- We went to do visa work in the morning, and I'm legal now. Shouldnt have to do visa work ever again. In the afternoon, we taught that Sebastian guy from monday. Elder Hansen taught him on Wednesday as well. We didnt have really any hope for him, but he's great. He prayed and said that he just knows that Joseph Smith is a prophet. He does great in the lessons and is interested. Just goes to show that anyone can get a testimony if they want to. We have really high hopes for him. 
<br><br>
Friday- We worked just in the morning, because in the afternoon we had a conference with Elder Godoy of the 70. He's awesome, and really funny. He constantly spoke a mix of Spanish, English, and Portuguese. He spoke on a lot of great things and I learned a ton. Awesome conference. At night we went to the Hospital, because Veronica was there. She had some complications cause I guess she's pregnant. I think it really made her happy that we visited her.
<br><br>
Saturday- Another intercambio. I went in our area with Elder Tovar from Peru. He has like 2 months, which was a change from Elder Hansen who has 22. We had a really good day though. The best lesson was with Marco Porco. He understood everything really well and seems ready. We put a baptismal date and hopefully he can keep going well. He has all the desires and I am just really glad to teach him. We also met a few other people, I picked cactus fruit from a cactus, and we just worked hard. I feel the pressure to do everything well on intercambios, so I can be an example. It was just a great day all together. 
<br><br>
Sunday- We had 3 missionaries that are going home monday, Elder Grigor, Laidlaw, and Howlett, visiting. It was weird to see them like that, just cause I remember when they had 4 months. All 3 great missionaries though. In the afternoon we had some good lessons. We talked to Richard's family, and they are still great. Their kid Chris is just the funniest kid ever. We also met the Flia Perez. The dad is a less active, and the mom isnt a member. They have 2 of the cutest little daughters ever. It might be a long process to get them going, but they'd be a great family. Missionaries have been trying for a while, but none since they saw a miracle and their niece's life was saved. Hopefully it's time. 
<br><br>
Monday- We're having a Cobija zone reunion and a bbq. I'll also probably say bye to Laidlaw until next fall. I'm really glad I'm staying here. It'll be a fun way to end. I know me and Hansen will work hard. Love you guys so much, and have a good week.

                        <p>Today didn't go exactly as planned. We left after studies to go to zone meeting. However, we couldn't get a hold of any keys for like 30min, so we just waited outside. We had a good district and zone meeting. The zone has progress a lot. After the meetings, and lunch, we went to the offices. It was all normal there. Davis started printing my trunki letter, so that's scary. After the offices we had one lesson. We went looking for this guy named Hugo, but we met his daughter Camila instead. She's... different. She's a member of the church Cristo Viene. That church is weird. We taught her for a little while, saw some drunk dude running around screaming, and all that. That was our only lesson of the day... fun. We were with Mauricio Ferrufino, the 2nd counselor, for a good part of the day. Today was just different than expected.</p>

                        <p>Intercambio... Actually, this one isn't too bad. Today I went with Elder Meadows. He's one of my good friends in the mission, so it was fun. Studies were good. We got off topic a little. After that we went and taught a less active family. Their area if rough, cause there's no one in the street. Lunch was fun though. After lunch, and looking around for things we did find one really cool lady named Patricia I think. I liked being out in the campo (countryside) cause it was just tranquiilo. I learned a lot from Elder Meadows as well. Even though I'm still a little tired of intercambios, it's still good if you go with a good missionary.</p>

                        <p>It seems like everytime we need to do weekly planning, we have to go do tramites. However, I think that's my last time, cause I'm legal now. We went home after that and did weekly planning. At 1 we had a lesson with Sebastian, the guy we met with Cesar and Lijia. He's really good. He's already gotten his answer that the church is true. He hopefully can progress. After that we met this guy named Rodrigo. I think he let us in just to be nice, but ya never know. We never thought Sebastian would be a good investigator, but the Lord picks, not us. We've really learned that anyone can progress if they want to. At night we just had ward council. Not bad, the leaders are really good, so consejo is actually productive. Tomorrow we get to meet a 70, so it should be good.</p>

                      <p>Today was cool. We didn't have a ton of time to work, but we did a little. We got a lesson in with Marlon. We're just really pushing to get him to go to church. After that we went to lunch, and then we went down to Arocahua. There we picked up Elder Prescott to head to a leadership conference. We went to the center and had a conference with Elder Carlos Godoy of the 70. He's great. He spoke a mixture of Spanish, English, and Portuguese. He's really funny, but had some great thoughts. The 2nd time I've met a 70, and they've both been absolutely great. To end the day, we went to the hospital because Veronica was there. We talked for a bit, and I think it was really good that we went. Maybe not a big numbers day, but a big learning day.<br><br><br></p>

                    <p>The last of the intercambios. Today I went with Elder Tovar. After studying in the morning, we went to the Cobija stake center, where we picked up a bunch of materials. Boxes of BoMs and stuff like that. After that we headed home and studied and worked. We had a few good lessons. We talked to Marlon a little, then we contacted this lady named Emilia. I helped pick cactus fruit, then we taught a little. We also talked to Marco Porco, who's awesome. He's understanding well and hopefully will progress. Probably my favorite of our investigators. He's got huge potential. At night we talked to Kevin, and then we ended the intercambio. It's fun to be with a new missionary, but I like being with Hansen and his 22 months more. Overall though, really good day.</p>

                    <p>Transfers!!! Well first, Sunday. It was a good day. Elder Laidlaw, Elder Grigor, and Elder Howlett were all there for their last Sunday, which is kinda weird, just that they're leaving. We had lunch with Grigor and Laidlaw, and then we worked. We had a lesson with Richard and Gladys, and then we taught the Flia PErez. It's a less active guy and his nonmember wife. Nice family, I'd love to see them progress. At night we had dinner with the Flia Rivero at a farewell for Grigor and Laidlaw. We also received the transfers. I was super nervous, but I'm staying. I'll finish out here, which makes me happy. Not too many crazy changes in the zone. Now I can just work hard till the end of my mission.</p>

                    <p>Today was a fun day. The morning was just normal. After doing email and all that, we went to Ingavi for a BBQ. We organized it as an old Cobija zone reunion and a little goodbye for Elder Laidlaw. We did it at Nacho's house. We had a good time, and it was cool to see everyone again. It'll be weird to not see Laidlaw for a few months though. After that I went with Hansen so he could do some souvenir shopping. I got kinda bored, but oh well. At night we had 2 lessons. First we taught this kid named Junior Fernandez. He's a less active, but a cool kid. We also had an FHE with Richard and Gladys's family. So ya, overall a good day. A good way to start this transfer.</p>
