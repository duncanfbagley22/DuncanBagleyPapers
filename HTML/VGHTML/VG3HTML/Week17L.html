Dear President,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interesting week. It was the first time in my entire mission where I couldnt work because I was sick. We did divisions though, so luckily Elder Hansen was able to work. I hate being sick, because I just wanted to help, but I physically couldnt. Our investigator that you met, Jesus, is kind of at a stand still. He is so busy with work that he never takes time to meet with us. We've probably called for appointments 5-10 times, but we havent taught him in like 3 weeks. He does go to all the activities though. Opposite of most investigators, he likes the members more than the missionaries. We're trying to get members to set up FHEs with him and then invite us. Hopefully it works. Most of our investigators have been like that. We have them for 1-3 lessons, but they just decide to go back to regular life or they decide the church isnt for them. Even people that have received confirmation of the truthfulness keep falling through. Maybe we are just here to plant seeds, which I think we've done a lot of. There are a lot of people that will probably be baptized one day, just not right now. The zone is kind of struggling right now. All the fruits from the work missionaries have done recently is being cultivated right now, but not much is being done for the future. It's just hard to get everyone to listen to us or care what we're saying. 2 of the district leaders are doing well. Elder Meadows is obviously great, but Elder Tronson is great as well. He's trying super hard with his district, they are just not responding too much. We are a little concerned with Elder Morales. His numbers are very low and we dont know why. When I went with him he did great, but I dont know what's happening the rest of the time. His district is suffering as well. Although the problems are frustrating sometimes, I like how it keeps me busy. I dont want to coast to the end of the mission, I need to run through the finish. I'm still learning a lot though and growing, so I know things are going well. Thanks
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Bagley

p.s We had to go help Elder Sharp and Elder Calderon. We found out that Elder Sharp is just going through some emotional problems. It seems like he had a hard life before the mission and had serious depression problems. He's being a bit rough on himself right now, and Elder Calderon isnt exactly the best support for him. I dont think you would need to do anything right now, but just to keep it on your radar. We'll deal with it for now.
<br><br>
p.p.s Sorry this is so long, but Elder Ruiz is concerned about his companion and wants to talk to you. He would call, but Elder Briceño always has the phone. We're going to try to work through the secretaries, but it would probably be a good idea to talk to Elder Ruiz whenever you get time. He's a great missionary, but his companion isnt helping too much for right now and Elder Ruiz is concerned about his obedience.

Thanks for your informative and insightful letter, Elder Bagley. I appreciate very much your faithfulness in the face of tough times. Keep the faith; the blessings will come in the Lord's time frame.
