            <h1>Week 15 <small>(March 30, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>Where'd all the good people go? (sung as Jack Johnson would sing it)</h3>
            <p><small>Hello again,<br>
    This was quite the week. Just... quite the week. I'm sure the title makes you think, but dont worry, I'll explain. Everything is going well right now. Well, I have sand in my hair cause we played beach volleyball as a zone today. Anyways, here's your Elder Bagley (the older one) rundown of the week, I hope you enjoy.
<br><br>
Monday- We had planned 3 lessons, and that was a record for us on a p day. However, we only were able to teach 1 of the 3 lessons. Lots of people here like to fall through on us. I'd say if 33% of the lessons are there, we are in luck. We had a lesson with Maria, the frenchish girl. She is pretty cool. She understands things pretty well and from what we've heard from her friends and neighbors, she needs the gospel. Her dad is a little abusive and she said she feels lonely in life, so that's what the gospel is here to fix.
<br><br>
Tuesday- Kinda a slow day. We had district meeting and zone meeting. We also had to go to the offices to do the financial stuff. At night we were going to teach Jesus, but he ended up playing soccer with the elders quorum instead. I mean, I wouldve loved to teach him, but it's good that he's starting to spend time with the ward and stuff. 
<br><br>
Wednesday- I went on an intercambio with Elder Briceño. He's from Peru. Really surprising intercambio. He's one of those kids you look at and dont expect much out of him. He's a skinny kid with big glasses and shy. However, he's one of the better missionaries I've ever done an intercambio with. He just always said the right thing and worked really hard. I learned a ton from him. Goes to show that anyone can be a good missionary if they try. Doesnt matter what we look like, if we want to be good we can be. 
<br><br>
Thursday- Nothing really special as far as progress, but we did have a cool experience. In the afternoon we contacted this guy, and instead of setting an appointment for later in the week, we just decided to set it for that afternoon, seeing how our appointments had fallen through. He said yes. We got there around 6, and he let us in. Like 2 minutes later, the sky started falling and it was raining super hard. Lightning struck close to us and it was scary/impressive. We couldnt hear anything cause it was all so loud. We finished teaching what we could, and as we left, the storm stopped. Nothing too crazy, but it was cool to see, in my humble opinion, how the Lord protected us.
<br><br>
Friday- Well... Friday was a learning experience. We got up in the morning and had to leave at 8 to go deal with an angry house owner. It was raining. We called for a taxi, and after we waited for 30 minutes, it never showed up. Then we walked down to the main road. While we were trying to grab a taxi, a car drove by super fast an ran over a puddle, causing a huge wave of water to soak us both. We headed out to the area, and proceeded to listen to this old lady complain for 15 minutes about the missionaries. The missionaries are sisters and are fine, just the lady is mad they're leaving (because her 25yr old single nephew who drinks moved in the same property). She just tried to find anything to blame on them, even though they werent really to blame. It was "fun". We got it all fixed and got out of there. After that we did a service project with the Flia Garcia. We helped clean their walls that we splattered with cement. We also had a lesson with Marlon that day. After that it was rough. We couldnt find anyone. People just arent home in our area. We also had our appts with Jesus and then with Maria fall through at night. We just had to sit there for a bit and regroup. It's hard when people just arent there to teach. You know that the gospel will help them, but if they dont accept it, or even give it a chance, nothing will change. Bolivians have a hard time dropping old traditions. They dont like change. 
<br><br>
Saturday- We were able to regroup, and get back to work. We had lunch with our bishop. He's rich, like really rich. He has 7 cars. He took us out to eat in a toyota highlander, with air conditioning and seat belts. He's a great bishop, works really hard. We also found a new "family to teach". It's a grandma and her 2 grandkids of 19 and 13. We actually had a pretty good lesson, and it was a relief to finally find someone. We also contacted this guy that speaks english. We knocked his door and he came out and basically said that he doesnt like missionaries. He was actually a little rude about it. We werent going to go down without a fight though. We asked why and we found out he doesnt like people that dont do what they preach. We promised him that we'd explain everything well and we got an appointment for sunday. He texted us on sunday and said he couldnt until wednesday, but everytime he talks to us he says sorry. Ya never know what can happen. The american culture in him is cool. He lived in Virginia (which has tens of thousands of bolivians living there, fyi) for 7 years, and is technically an american citizen. 
<br><br>
Sunday- Sunday was local elections. With elections here, everything shuts down. We couldnt even have church. It was a good day to find people though. We taught a few people. My favorite lesson was with Jhery and Veronica. Recently Veronica had a miscarriage. Usually when bad things happen, people either get closer to the gospel, or farther. They chose the first. Jhery was telling us about everything and he said it was a time where he felt closer to God. He even read the Liahona and found stuff that applied to him. He really gained a testimony of the atonement in the past few weeks. Awesome people. We also talked to that family again and taught a kid named Junior. He's a 19yr old kid. His family is active, but he's not. I really think one day he could be a missionary, so we wanna help him with that. He's making small progress, which is cool. 
<br><br>
Monday- We played beach volleyball as a zone and ate lunch together. Tonight we have an FHE with the Flia Valle in our ward. 
<br><br>
So why is the email titled that? For this
<br><br>
Jesus - We didnt teach him all week. He's been busy with work, so we havent seen him. He's on a bit of a downhill, so we need to help him regroup.
<br><br>
Maria- She was never home and had her phone stolen. Couldnt find her either.
<br><br>
Flia Rojas (the factory people) - Were never home and didnt answer the phone
<br><br>
It was kinda ridiculous how people just disappear sometimes. We'll keep working though. We realized that a big part of the mission is more what we learn. We'll learn by helping other people, but in the end we are probably the most important person that we need to change. I love you guys, and I'm excited for conference. Like really really excited. Keep it real
<br><br>
