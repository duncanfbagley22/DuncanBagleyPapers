            <h1>Week 15 <small>(March 30, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>Where'd all the good people go? (sung as Jack Johnson would sing it)</h3>
            <p><small>Hello again,<br>
    This was quite the week. Just... quite the week. I'm sure the title makes you think, but dont worry, I'll explain. Everything is going well right now. Well, I have sand in my hair cause we played beach volleyball as a zone today. Anyways, here's your Elder Bagley (the older one) rundown of the week, I hope you enjoy.
<br><br>
Monday- We had planned 3 lessons, and that was a record for us on a p day. However, we only were able to teach 1 of the 3 lessons. Lots of people here like to fall through on us. I'd say if 33% of the lessons are there, we are in luck. We had a lesson with Maria, the frenchish girl. She is pretty cool. She understands things pretty well and from what we've heard from her friends and neighbors, she needs the gospel. Her dad is a little abusive and she said she feels lonely in life, so that's what the gospel is here to fix.
<br><br>
Tuesday- Kinda a slow day. We had district meeting and zone meeting. We also had to go to the offices to do the financial stuff. At night we were going to teach Jesus, but he ended up playing soccer with the elders quorum instead. I mean, I wouldve loved to teach him, but it's good that he's starting to spend time with the ward and stuff. 
<br><br>
Wednesday- I went on an intercambio with Elder Briceño. He's from Peru. Really surprising intercambio. He's one of those kids you look at and dont expect much out of him. He's a skinny kid with big glasses and shy. However, he's one of the better missionaries I've ever done an intercambio with. He just always said the right thing and worked really hard. I learned a ton from him. Goes to show that anyone can be a good missionary if they try. Doesnt matter what we look like, if we want to be good we can be. 
<br><br>
Thursday- Nothing really special as far as progress, but we did have a cool experience. In the afternoon we contacted this guy, and instead of setting an appointment for later in the week, we just decided to set it for that afternoon, seeing how our appointments had fallen through. He said yes. We got there around 6, and he let us in. Like 2 minutes later, the sky started falling and it was raining super hard. Lightning struck close to us and it was scary/impressive. We couldnt hear anything cause it was all so loud. We finished teaching what we could, and as we left, the storm stopped. Nothing too crazy, but it was cool to see, in my humble opinion, how the Lord protected us.
<br><br>
Friday- Well... Friday was a learning experience. We got up in the morning and had to leave at 8 to go deal with an angry house owner. It was raining. We called for a taxi, and after we waited for 30 minutes, it never showed up. Then we walked down to the main road. While we were trying to grab a taxi, a car drove by super fast an ran over a puddle, causing a huge wave of water to soak us both. We headed out to the area, and proceeded to listen to this old lady complain for 15 minutes about the missionaries. The missionaries are sisters and are fine, just the lady is mad they're leaving (because her 25yr old single nephew who drinks moved in the same property). She just tried to find anything to blame on them, even though they werent really to blame. It was "fun". We got it all fixed and got out of there. After that we did a service project with the Flia Garcia. We helped clean their walls that we splattered with cement. We also had a lesson with Marlon that day. After that it was rough. We couldnt find anyone. People just arent home in our area. We also had our appts with Jesus and then with Maria fall through at night. We just had to sit there for a bit and regroup. It's hard when people just arent there to teach. You know that the gospel will help them, but if they dont accept it, or even give it a chance, nothing will change. Bolivians have a hard time dropping old traditions. They dont like change. 
<br><br>
Saturday- We were able to regroup, and get back to work. We had lunch with our bishop. He's rich, like really rich. He has 7 cars. He took us out to eat in a toyota highlander, with air conditioning and seat belts. He's a great bishop, works really hard. We also found a new "family to teach". It's a grandma and her 2 grandkids of 19 and 13. We actually had a pretty good lesson, and it was a relief to finally find someone. We also contacted this guy that speaks english. We knocked his door and he came out and basically said that he doesnt like missionaries. He was actually a little rude about it. We werent going to go down without a fight though. We asked why and we found out he doesnt like people that dont do what they preach. We promised him that we'd explain everything well and we got an appointment for sunday. He texted us on sunday and said he couldnt until wednesday, but everytime he talks to us he says sorry. Ya never know what can happen. The american culture in him is cool. He lived in Virginia (which has tens of thousands of bolivians living there, fyi) for 7 years, and is technically an american citizen. 
<br><br>
Sunday- Sunday was local elections. With elections here, everything shuts down. We couldnt even have church. It was a good day to find people though. We taught a few people. My favorite lesson was with Jhery and Veronica. Recently Veronica had a miscarriage. Usually when bad things happen, people either get closer to the gospel, or farther. They chose the first. Jhery was telling us about everything and he said it was a time where he felt closer to God. He even read the Liahona and found stuff that applied to him. He really gained a testimony of the atonement in the past few weeks. Awesome people. We also talked to that family again and taught a kid named Junior. He's a 19yr old kid. His family is active, but he's not. I really think one day he could be a missionary, so we wanna help him with that. He's making small progress, which is cool. 
<br><br>
Monday- We played beach volleyball as a zone and ate lunch together. Tonight we have an FHE with the Flia Valle in our ward. 
<br><br>
So why is the email titled that? For this
<br><br>
Jesus - We didnt teach him all week. He's been busy with work, so we havent seen him. He's on a bit of a downhill, so we need to help him regroup.
<br><br>
Maria- She was never home and had her phone stolen. Couldnt find her either.
<br><br>
Flia Rojas (the factory people) - Were never home and didnt answer the phone
<br><br>
It was kinda ridiculous how people just disappear sometimes. We'll keep working though. We realized that a big part of the mission is more what we learn. We'll learn by helping other people, but in the end we are probably the most important person that we need to change. I love you guys, and I'm excited for conference. Like really really excited. Keep it real

                        <p>Tiring day, with nothing to show for it. After studing in the morning, we went to the district meeting. We got a good class from E' Meadows and then we taught. We're being a little harsher recently, just cause the zone needs it. We had a little meeting with the DLs to try and get things going in the zone. Hopefully it gets better. After lunch we went out to work with Alvaro. It was a real bummer though cause we couldn't find anyone. I hate when we take members out and we can't find anything. After that we went to the office and hung out there and then we came back and went to the chapel to teach Jesus. We didn't end up teaching him, because he was playing soccer there. It sucks to not teach him, but at least he's building "amistades" (sounds better in spanish).</p>

                        <p>Intercambio. Today I went with Elder Briceño from Piura, Peru. He's a quiet, awkward guy, but he's a really good missionary. After studies we went out and worked. First we taught a lady named Beatriz. She's nice, but one of those people that think that work is everything. After lunch we went and talked to Richard and Gladys. They fell through on us because of problems in Gladys's family. They just suck. We had a good lesson with them though. After that we had a lesson with Marlon. We talked about the gospel of Christ and that and he understood well. I just want to know what to do to get him progressing more. At night we ended the intercambio and then me and Hansen taught Kevin. It was a really good intercambio, I definitely feel like I learned the most.</p>

                        <p>Interesting day. In the morning we had studies and weekly planning. Yet again, I'm not a huge fan of weekly planning. Only like 9 more times on the mission. After the morning, and lunch, we went out and worked. We couldn't find much to do though. We had a fun lesson with Felix. He's an interesting guy. He always is talking about how we shouldn't dance or have fun in church and stuff. Plus he's communist, fun stuff. In the afternoon we had a cool experience. We luckily had contacted some guy earlier and in the afternoon we had an appt. Right as we got in his house a huge storm started. As we left, the storm ended. Basically the only good lesson we had, and it protected us from a huge storm. Blessings. At night we had consejo and it was good. Really big fan of the ward. Glad to be in Villa Graciela.</p>

                      <p>Rough day. The morning was as rough as can be. We waited for a taxi for a half hour, but it never showed up. Then we walked down to the circuvalacion to get one. While waiting a car drove by and hit a puddle that splashed a wave on us. It was like a movie. We then went to Esmeralda, where we had to talk to an angry house owner. She was crying and being mad and saying sorry and was just a whole bunch of fun. Great morning. We did go to Richard's house for a service. We scrubbed cement off the walls. After lunch we had a lesson with Marlon. From there on out, everything sucked. We couldn't find anyone, people cancelled or fell through on lessons and everything was terrible. Once the last 2 things fell through, we just sat there and talked and thought for a while. Sometimes it's rough to not have success. We need to regroup a little.</p>

                    <p>Kinda regrouped today. I don't know why, but I guess it's important for us to be struggling during this period of time. We'll continue on and that's what we did today. In the morning we just did a bit of contacting and then we ate lunch with the bishop and his family. It was a weird experience. We went to a nice place, and just everything about the bishop screams USA. Made me think way too much about home. The bishop is awesome though. In the afternoon we had a lesson with some new people. The Flia Perez, it's a grandma and her 2 grandkids of 19 and 13. Not a terrible lesson, and gave us hope. We also met Nora's daughter, and then at night we taught Daniela. It wasn't a great day, but good enough to get the "ánimos" back up.</p>

                    <p>Weird day. It was Sunday, but we didn't go to church. Because of Bolivian elections, we couldn't go to church. Sometimes I hate Bolivian laws. However, we did get a lot of lessons in. There were a few that were good. We taught Junior a bit. He's gone from not praying to praying once a day... improvement. We also taught Amanda (Flia Perez) again. She's not a terrible investigator, and could progress easily if she wants to. We had Jhony with us all day which was good too. We had a lesson with Jhery and Veronica. They're doing well. They were going through some hard times the last few weeks, but it's better now. Their testimonies are getting stronger and during the rough times they were with God more. Cool to see them becoming more converted. Quick day, weird to not go to church.</p>

                    <p>I'm really pleased about today. We had a p-day activity that actually worked out 100% fine. We played beach volleyball. Everyone enjoyed it, we got it for a good amount, it didn't really rain, etc. I played pretty well, I like volleyball. We had a game that we won 11-0; I scored those 11pts on my serves only. I include that so my descendants know that I was a decent volleyball player. Afterwards we went to eat as a zone, and it went perfectly. Glad it all turned out so well. At night we had a good time as well. We taught a lesson to Milton. We explained things well, and he had some good questions. We also had a really good FHE with the Flia Valle. Awesome family. We ate tacos and had a good spiritual conversation. E' Gonzales bore a testimony and cried and it was super strong. Great day. Interesting facts of the day: we are going to open an area in Amancayas. Also, I get tunnel vision way too much.</p>
