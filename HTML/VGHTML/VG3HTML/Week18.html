            <h1>Week 18 <small>(April 20, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>God Bless America</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
   I couldnt think of a good title, I think that I've already used all the good ones in the other 90ish letters that I've written. I decided to name it this for 2 reasons. 1) Elder Hansen played that song like every day because it's a great song, and because he leaves today to go to America. 2) I got my transfer yesterday and I'm going to be with my record setting 5th northamerican companion. I'm going to be with Elder Bradford from California. Not sure what part, but it is California. I know him pretty well. He's a funny kid and a good missionary. He started in Churuquella as well, so I met him there. We're going to have a good transfer. Anyways, back to the regular contents of my letters, the weekly summary.
 <br><br>
Monday- We had an FHE with Richard's family. I really like them. They keep getting so close to going to church, and then something happens and they dont quite make it. Last week they had everything laid out and ready, and then the landlord showed up. This week they left and got to the church, dressed up and everything, but they got there late and there wasnt space to park, so they didnt go in (not the best excuse ever). They'll get there soon though.
 <br><br>
Tuesday- We had zone meeting and a special medical conference with some guy from the area. Not the most exciting thing ever. We also went to the office. Before we went to our ward mission meeting thing, we knocked some door and met a family. I think the dad just let us in to teach his son english, but we taught them a lesson anyways. The ends justify the means right? The dad is a college professor, so a smart guy. They werent there for the second lesson, but we'll go back later.
 <br><br>
Wednesday- Just a regular day. We met some lady in the morning who we taught while her 1yr old kid screamed and ran around the whole time. We also taught Hno Chocala. Her daughters got baptized like 8 months ago, and she's starting to pick up some interest. We taught her (actually, it was mostly Hansen. I had a cold all week and could barely talk) about the restoration and it went well. I think she's starting to realize that her family needs the gospel, all of them. That's good, because they do. We also had a meeting with Pdte Hansen and the stake president. We just tried to get more ideas to help the stake. We're trying to get things going with the WMLs. Like 2 months ago we told him that one ward didnt have one, then a week later they got one, then a week ago the WML's nephew got baptized by the missionaries there because the WML had given him as a reference. That's how things are supposed to work.
 <br><br>
Thursday- We did weekly planning in the morning and then we worked in the afternoon. We went to this guy who we have contacted a bunch of times. We always used the fact that Hansen was leaving as an extra incentive to have people listen. This time it worked. The guy is named Luis and he let us in and we watched a video. He has 4 kids and usually is a stay at home dad. Hopefully we can get him progressing. We also taught Amanda Perez, her mom Lesli, and her mom Concepcion. 3 Generation lesson. They are all doing well. They all read and they just love the missionaries. At night we had ward council, where they had a small little farewell for Hansen.
 <br><br>
Friday- We went and dropped off Hansen for a training meeting and then I went with Elder Vanegas from Colombia. We spent most of the day in his area. We taught this guy named Mauricio who is awesome. They found him because he was going to institute for a month without knowing the missionaries. Super prepared, fun to teach. At night in my area we went and talked to Jhery and Veronica. They're still great, but they always are going to need some help from the missionaries, at least for the next year or so.
 <br><br>
Saturday- In the morning we had a lesson with this kid we met in my area named Cristian. Good kid, really curious. We ran a bunch of errands the rest of the day, getting materials from the mission storage place and looking for a new house for the new missionaries coming to our area.
 <br><br>
Sunday- I went on splits, so I could work the whole time in my area. I went with this kid named Jhony. Great kid. He got baptized like 2 years ago and since then 9 of his friends have been baptized. He always goes to pick up less actives or just does anything to help the work. Great kid, really excited to be a missionary. We taught a few lessons. We met Hna Chocala's husband and taught some others. Best part was that Amanda and Lesli went to church. They really liked it and stayed the whole time. They cried when Hansen left. Like I said, they really like us. At night I received the transfers and was on the phone for like 80minutes continuously talking to the zone and stuff like that. That day I also had some drunk guy telling me that I didnt have permission to be in Bolivia and that I needed to leave. I just walked by and said that I would leave soon. Drunk people are funny.
 <br><br>
Monday- Elder Meadows's family came to pick him up, so they took out all of his former companions (including Elder Vanegas) to eat breakfast. I got to go as well. They're nice people, kinda weird to meet peoples' families though. I dont know what the plan is for tonight.
 <br><br>
So that's the week. I'm excited to get my new companion and get back to work. I love you guys and I thought that I would share some of the scriptures I found today. It's James 2:14-20 I think. I just like how it says that demons (I read it in spanishs, so I dont know the exact english words) have faith without works. They know God lives, they just do the opposite of what he asks. We need faith and works. Without the works, the faith doesnt count. God Speed<br>
