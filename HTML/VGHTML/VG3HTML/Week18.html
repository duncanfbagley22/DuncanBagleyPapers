            <h1>Week 18 <small>(April 20, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>God Bless America</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
   I couldnt think of a good title, I think that I've already used all the good ones in the other 90ish letters that I've written. I decided to name it this for 2 reasons. 1) Elder Hansen played that song like every day because it's a great song, and because he leaves today to go to America. 2) I got my transfer yesterday and I'm going to be with my record setting 5th northamerican companion. I'm going to be with Elder Bradford from California. Not sure what part, but it is California. I know him pretty well. He's a funny kid and a good missionary. He started in Churuquella as well, so I met him there. We're going to have a good transfer. Anyways, back to the regular contents of my letters, the weekly summary.
 <br><br>
Monday- We had an FHE with Richard's family. I really like them. They keep getting so close to going to church, and then something happens and they dont quite make it. Last week they had everything laid out and ready, and then the landlord showed up. This week they left and got to the church, dressed up and everything, but they got there late and there wasnt space to park, so they didnt go in (not the best excuse ever). They'll get there soon though.
 <br><br>
Tuesday- We had zone meeting and a special medical conference with some guy from the area. Not the most exciting thing ever. We also went to the office. Before we went to our ward mission meeting thing, we knocked some door and met a family. I think the dad just let us in to teach his son english, but we taught them a lesson anyways. The ends justify the means right? The dad is a college professor, so a smart guy. They werent there for the second lesson, but we'll go back later.
 <br><br>
Wednesday- Just a regular day. We met some lady in the morning who we taught while her 1yr old kid screamed and ran around the whole time. We also taught Hno Chocala. Her daughters got baptized like 8 months ago, and she's starting to pick up some interest. We taught her (actually, it was mostly Hansen. I had a cold all week and could barely talk) about the restoration and it went well. I think she's starting to realize that her family needs the gospel, all of them. That's good, because they do. We also had a meeting with Pdte Hansen and the stake president. We just tried to get more ideas to help the stake. We're trying to get things going with the WMLs. Like 2 months ago we told him that one ward didnt have one, then a week later they got one, then a week ago the WML's nephew got baptized by the missionaries there because the WML had given him as a reference. That's how things are supposed to work.
 <br><br>
Thursday- We did weekly planning in the morning and then we worked in the afternoon. We went to this guy who we have contacted a bunch of times. We always used the fact that Hansen was leaving as an extra incentive to have people listen. This time it worked. The guy is named Luis and he let us in and we watched a video. He has 4 kids and usually is a stay at home dad. Hopefully we can get him progressing. We also taught Amanda Perez, her mom Lesli, and her mom Concepcion. 3 Generation lesson. They are all doing well. They all read and they just love the missionaries. At night we had ward council, where they had a small little farewell for Hansen.
 <br><br>
Friday- We went and dropped off Hansen for a training meeting and then I went with Elder Vanegas from Colombia. We spent most of the day in his area. We taught this guy named Mauricio who is awesome. They found him because he was going to institute for a month without knowing the missionaries. Super prepared, fun to teach. At night in my area we went and talked to Jhery and Veronica. They're still great, but they always are going to need some help from the missionaries, at least for the next year or so.
 <br><br>
Saturday- In the morning we had a lesson with this kid we met in my area named Cristian. Good kid, really curious. We ran a bunch of errands the rest of the day, getting materials from the mission storage place and looking for a new house for the new missionaries coming to our area.
 <br><br>
Sunday- I went on splits, so I could work the whole time in my area. I went with this kid named Jhony. Great kid. He got baptized like 2 years ago and since then 9 of his friends have been baptized. He always goes to pick up less actives or just does anything to help the work. Great kid, really excited to be a missionary. We taught a few lessons. We met Hna Chocala's husband and taught some others. Best part was that Amanda and Lesli went to church. They really liked it and stayed the whole time. They cried when Hansen left. Like I said, they really like us. At night I received the transfers and was on the phone for like 80minutes continuously talking to the zone and stuff like that. That day I also had some drunk guy telling me that I didnt have permission to be in Bolivia and that I needed to leave. I just walked by and said that I would leave soon. Drunk people are funny.
 <br><br>
Monday- Elder Meadows's family came to pick him up, so they took out all of his former companions (including Elder Vanegas) to eat breakfast. I got to go as well. They're nice people, kinda weird to meet peoples' families though. I dont know what the plan is for tonight.
 <br><br>
So that's the week. I'm excited to get my new companion and get back to work. I love you guys and I thought that I would share some of the scriptures I found today. It's James 2:14-20 I think. I just like how it says that demons (I read it in spanishs, so I dont know the exact english words) have faith without works. They know God lives, they just do the opposite of what he asks. We need faith and works. Without the works, the faith doesnt count. God Speed<br>

                        <p>Hansen's last district meeting. Basically everything we do now is Hansen's last. Today was different though. We had to go to the Universidad stake center. For about an hour and a half we had district and zone meeting, and then we had a special health meeting with the area doctor. Stuff I've heard many times, but it was good. After lunch, we went to the offices, and then we went back to the area to work. We didn't have much, but we did find a new family. We knocked the door and a guy let us in probably because we speak english and he wants his son to speak english. We watched a video and taught a bit. They're the Flia Torres, and we have another appt on sunday. We ended the day with Correlacion misional at Hno Rivero's house.</p>

                        <p>Today was just a regular day. I woke up just feeling like crap. I can't breathe, my throat hurts, and I'm just tired. Diarrea one week and a cold the next. We did have a good day though. In the morning we found this lady named Paola. Not bad. After lunch, we had a lesson with the Flia Chocala. The mom is doing well and is gaining interest. She wants her whole family to be part of the church. We also had a lesson with Marlon. We were ready to give him waska for not going to church, until we found out he didn't go because he had a relative get hit by a motorcycle and he had to help... good thing we asked why first. We also had a meeting with the stake president and Pres Hansen. I like working with the stake leaders. That's the day, hopefully I can feel better.</p>

                        <p>Hansen's last real day... kinda weird. In the morning we had studies and stuff. We also had "weekly planning". Actually, we just updated the area book. We wouldn't have really focused if we did planning, at least Hansen... After lunch, we went out and worked. I wanted to have a good last day for Hansen, but we couldn't really find much. After not finding much for a while, we knocked a door of an old contact and pushed really hard to get in. We finally got in, watched a video, and had a good lesson. His name is Luis Yapura and he's a pretty good guy. We also had a lesson with Concepción, Amanda, and Amanda's mom Leslie. They actually have lots of potential. They also love the missionaries, like a lot. We finished the day with ward council. So we actually did have a good last day for Hansen. Glad that he could go out on a good note.</p>

                      <p>And... Hansen is gone. We got up and went to the Universidad stake center to drop him off. Then I met up with Elder Vanegas from Colombia. He was with Elder Meadows, who's ending as well, so he was companion-less. We went and dropped some stuff off to some missionaries and then to study. We ate lunch in Esmeralda and then we worked. We had a really good lesson in Esmeralda with a guy named Mauricio. He's just a golden investigator; really interested and understands and should be baptized really soon. We didn't really find a ton in my area at night. We did get to talk to Jhery and Veronica though. They're a family that the missionaries will be with for a while, cause they'll need help, but I still love 'em. We talked about humility, something that can never be taught too many times. Good day, but I miss Hansen.</p>

                    <p>Another busy day. We studied in the morning, all normal. At 10 we had a lesson with a guy named Cristian Orozco. We contacted him in a tienda and he's actually pretty good. He's curious about everything. After that we went to pick up materials in the city, then we went to go drop off baptismal clothing. After lunch (which is a fun experience here because E' Vanegas and H' Olivas fight the whole time) we went to work a little in Esmeralda, but we didn't find anything. Looking for a house is like knocking doors, but worse. At night we went to a baptism in Huayani. The hermanas baptized a family so that was cool. We finished the day teaching Kevin. He's been slowly declining and it worries me. He's a good kid, but the church isn't a priority like it should be. End.</p>

                    <p>Success!!! We finally got some good people to church. We woke up in the morning and went and picked up Amanda and Lesli... and they were there and ready to go. We took them and went to church. They stayed the whole time and seemed to enjoy it. Hansen and Long got there at the end, so we got to see them a little. When Hansen said bye to Leslie and Amanda they started crying. They really like us. After church I went out to work with Jhony. We first taught the Flia Chocala. After that we ran by Richard's house, and we finished teaching Maria Leclair again. At night we had cambios... I'm going to be with Elder Bradford. Great transfer, going to be really fun. The zone seems decent, so hopefully it'll be ok. Last transfers night, it's kinda weird.</p>

                    <p>Interesting p-day. We woke up and studied, and then we headed to the city. We didn't know which trufi would take us there, so we took one that left us like 30min away. Normally being lost in a foreign country would be bad, but I've been in Cocha for like 15 months, so I can get around easily. We then ate salteñas with Elder Meadows's family. He had all his old companions there, and since I'm with Elder Vanegas, I got to go. It was cool to meet them, but weird because I said bye to Hansen, Long, Meadows, and Skousen. Some of my best mission friends, so it's sad to see them go. After that and email and stuff, we went back to Esmeralda. We really couldn't find anyone, but we eventually got a quick chat with some active members. We ended the night with dinner and then went home. Ready to get a new comp tomorrow.</p>
