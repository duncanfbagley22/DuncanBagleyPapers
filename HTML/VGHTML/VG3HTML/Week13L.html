Dear President,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we ended last week, I thought it was really good, but it was nothing compared to this week. Honestly, this week was one of the most miraculous I've ever experienced on my mission. I saw plenty of miracles, and a lot of times Elder Hansen and I were just speechless. The first happened on Wednesday. We had a lot of things fall through. That day we ended up with something like 23 contacts. At the end of the day, Elder Hansen suggested that we knock a door. We were in a part of the area we rarely go to, but we decided to knock a big rich house. A man opened and let us in. Then as we were talking, we found out more about him. That night he had a really big fight with his wife and we showed up just as he was leaving to a hotel. I cant describe it well in words, but it was so obvious that God had guided us there. The lesson was one of the more spiritual experiences in a long time. Just an obvious miracle, and it really gave me a different outlook on things. I thought that that was enough miracles for the week, but on Sunday we met a reference named Jesus that is incredible. He and his daughter came to church and they are so prepared. In the first lesson the daughter asked how she could get baptized, and as we ended with a prayer, the father began to cry as he prayed and the spirit came super strong. He's a great person and so ready for the gospel. He's already recognizing the spirit and it's great. Honestly, I just saw the power of God this week. Many testimony strengthing experiences. We were dead tired at the end of the week, but it was worth it. The zone is a little inexperienced, but they're good missionaries, so we just want to help them reach their potential. Thanks for everything.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Bagley

I really liked meeting Jesus, as I could tell immediately that he is a good man with a good heart. I so hope and pray that he will keep commitments and be baptized along with his sweet little daughter.
<br>
I am extremely happy with the fireside. I love how you worked so hard to pull it off well. Thank you, thank you, thank you. The music was top notch and added so much to the great spirit of that meeting. This will help deepen the love the members have for the missionaries.
