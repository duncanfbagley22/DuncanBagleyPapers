            <h3>I SAW A MONKEY</h3>
            <p><small>Dear family,<br>
   Well, to start off, I saw a monkey this week. The one animal that I hadnt ever seen here, I finally did. It just lives on a wall at some house, so I'll take more pictures later. I was really pumped to see it, and I couldnt really think of another title, so I figured the monkey was good enough. As for the mission related stuff, which is more important, this was a good week. A little stressful, but good. Here's what happened...
<br><br>
Monday- We literally just took a nap for p day, great decision. Our lesson fell through, so we just had an FHE with the Flia Ferrufino of our ward.
<br><br>
Tuesday- We had to teach the zone class, and it went well. The problem is that the people that work well and are obedient, are the ones that pay attention, and the ones we really want to help, dont really pay attention. Being a leader, or just a missionary in general, helps me understand how frustrating things must be for God. He wants to help us, but his way is better. He knows what is best, but we are prideful and choose our way sometimes. That's how I feel teaching investigators and missionaries sometimes. Makes me want to follow better and obey more exactly though. That night we taught Jesus again. He's just a great humble guy, and he really likes the church. We have high hopes.
<br><br>
Wednesday- We had interviews in the morning. Mine was more focused on the zone than anything else. I still like talking to President Hansen though. I'm sure my next interview will be better, it'll be at the end of may and there'll be a ton to talk about. That day we also taught the best, most diverse lineup of investigators ever. <br>
1) We taught Marlon, a dentist. We teach in his office. We are running through all the lessons and so far he understands very well. <br>
2) We just so happened to contact this family that works in this door/window shop. The shop is owned by the stake president and his family (a bishop and a patriarch). 3 of the workers are now investigators, that can all pray and have been to general conference before. One, Eric, lives in our area with his wife. They have potential. The other worker just got back from a mission 3 weeks ago, and helps in teaching.<br>
3) We taught Milton aka Mufasa. He explained to us the craziness of the trufi (the small buses) business and how people burn cars and stuff. He's got a lot of questions and understands mostly, so he's good. <br>
4) Finally, last sunday while on splits, Elder Hansen got a reference for this girl. Her name is Maria. Her mom is french and she lived in Paris for a year. She is studying to be a pilot and works as...a model. Surprisingly, she's a decent investigator. <br>
So ya, we taught a dentist, 3 factory workers, a guy named Musafa that has bus wars basically, and a half french model. Quite the day in Bolivia. 
<br><br>
Thursday- Nothin too special, just another solid lesson with Jesus.
<br><br>
Friday- Intercambio. I went to the other area in our ward with Elder Gonzales from Santa Cruz. We walked all over the place. I liked getting to meet the other people and learning what I could from Elder Gonzales. He lived quite the different life before, but the mission has helped him. I saw the monkey on friday as well. 
<br><br>
Saturday- We had just a regular day. We went to a stake activity with Jesus because his daughter was dancing with the YW. We taught the factory people again, and at night we taught Waldo. There's some sort of seed of faith planted now and you can tell. We really need to meet his wife, because I think one day the whole family could be members. It's a process, but there're little flashs of potential every so often. He'll get there one day, as long as we keep working.
<br><br>
Sunday- I'll just right to the Noche Fogonera. So the plan for the fireside was to have a recent convert and a reactivated member share their testimonies. The RC showed up to church and went to the fireside and gave a great testimony. The reactivated guy didnt show up to church, and after we called 15 times, we still couldnt find him. We were trying everything we could to find someone from any ward, but no one could do it. One elder suggested someone, but then we found out he wasnt ever less active. We didnt end up getting anyone, so we were frustrated. Also, we had to try to get the 24 missionaries organized, which is also hard. I felt like I was in Rachel's spot for a second. However, the fireside turned out great. I was in a choir thingy and we sang Abide with me tis eventide/abide with me and it went well. We had a vocal solo and a violon/piano duet. It was all good. I didnt think we had anyone there, but as we ended and we were leaving we saw Jesus and Ariana there. We had them meet President and I was just so glad they went.
<br><br>
So ya, there's my stressful week. I'm glad it's over. It's good that I'll have to be stressed like this till the end of the mission, that way there's no time to think too much about home. I love you guys, have a great week.
<br><br>
