            <h1>Week 14 <small>(March 23, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>I SAW A MONKEY</h3>
            <p><small>Dear family,<br>
   Well, to start off, I saw a monkey this week. The one animal that I hadnt ever seen here, I finally did. It just lives on a wall at some house, so I'll take more pictures later. I was really pumped to see it, and I couldnt really think of another title, so I figured the monkey was good enough. As for the mission related stuff, which is more important, this was a good week. A little stressful, but good. Here's what happened...
<br><br>
Monday- We literally just took a nap for p day, great decision. Our lesson fell through, so we just had an FHE with the Flia Ferrufino of our ward.
<br><br>
Tuesday- We had to teach the zone class, and it went well. The problem is that the people that work well and are obedient, are the ones that pay attention, and the ones we really want to help, dont really pay attention. Being a leader, or just a missionary in general, helps me understand how frustrating things must be for God. He wants to help us, but his way is better. He knows what is best, but we are prideful and choose our way sometimes. That's how I feel teaching investigators and missionaries sometimes. Makes me want to follow better and obey more exactly though. That night we taught Jesus again. He's just a great humble guy, and he really likes the church. We have high hopes.
<br><br>
Wednesday- We had interviews in the morning. Mine was more focused on the zone than anything else. I still like talking to President Hansen though. I'm sure my next interview will be better, it'll be at the end of may and there'll be a ton to talk about. That day we also taught the best, most diverse lineup of investigators ever. <br>
1) We taught Marlon, a dentist. We teach in his office. We are running through all the lessons and so far he understands very well. <br>
2) We just so happened to contact this family that works in this door/window shop. The shop is owned by the stake president and his family (a bishop and a patriarch). 3 of the workers are now investigators, that can all pray and have been to general conference before. One, Eric, lives in our area with his wife. They have potential. The other worker just got back from a mission 3 weeks ago, and helps in teaching.<br>
3) We taught Milton aka Mufasa. He explained to us the craziness of the trufi (the small buses) business and how people burn cars and stuff. He's got a lot of questions and understands mostly, so he's good. <br>
4) Finally, last sunday while on splits, Elder Hansen got a reference for this girl. Her name is Maria. Her mom is french and she lived in Paris for a year. She is studying to be a pilot and works as...a model. Surprisingly, she's a decent investigator. <br>
So ya, we taught a dentist, 3 factory workers, a guy named Musafa that has bus wars basically, and a half french model. Quite the day in Bolivia. 
<br><br>
Thursday- Nothin too special, just another solid lesson with Jesus.
<br><br>
Friday- Intercambio. I went to the other area in our ward with Elder Gonzales from Santa Cruz. We walked all over the place. I liked getting to meet the other people and learning what I could from Elder Gonzales. He lived quite the different life before, but the mission has helped him. I saw the monkey on friday as well. 
<br><br>
Saturday- We had just a regular day. We went to a stake activity with Jesus because his daughter was dancing with the YW. We taught the factory people again, and at night we taught Waldo. There's some sort of seed of faith planted now and you can tell. We really need to meet his wife, because I think one day the whole family could be members. It's a process, but there're little flashs of potential every so often. He'll get there one day, as long as we keep working.
<br><br>
Sunday- I'll just right to the Noche Fogonera. So the plan for the fireside was to have a recent convert and a reactivated member share their testimonies. The RC showed up to church and went to the fireside and gave a great testimony. The reactivated guy didnt show up to church, and after we called 15 times, we still couldnt find him. We were trying everything we could to find someone from any ward, but no one could do it. One elder suggested someone, but then we found out he wasnt ever less active. We didnt end up getting anyone, so we were frustrated. Also, we had to try to get the 24 missionaries organized, which is also hard. I felt like I was in Rachel's spot for a second. However, the fireside turned out great. I was in a choir thingy and we sang Abide with me tis eventide/abide with me and it went well. We had a vocal solo and a violon/piano duet. It was all good. I didnt think we had anyone there, but as we ended and we were leaving we saw Jesus and Ariana there. We had them meet President and I was just so glad they went.
<br><br>
So ya, there's my stressful week. I'm glad it's over. It's good that I'll have to be stressed like this till the end of the mission, that way there's no time to think too much about home. I love you guys, have a great week.

                        <p>To begin the day, I was a bit stressed. We have a lot of stuff going on. We have to deal with our area, the zone, we have to get all the musical numbers planned for Sunday, we have to get people to speak on Sunday, and we had to teach his own class. Then we found out that Pres Hansen was going to be at the zone meeting later on to see everything. Well, we prepared everything and it turned out OK. We taught the class, then we figured out who was going to speak, and then we practiced the musical numbers. Everything came together, so I'm not as stressed now. In the afternoon, we went to the offices, and then we had 2 lessons. First, we talked to Nora for a bit. She's tough to teach sometimes, just cause she doesn't understand. We also talked to Jesus. He's a really solid investigator. I have really high hopes. He already asked for work off on Sundays so that he can go to church. We finished the night with correlacion misional. The day ended a lot better than it started.</p>

                        <p>Interviews... well kind of. We went in for interviews, but at least for me, it wasn't too special. We just talked about the zone and the fireside that's coming up. It was more just an administrative interview. I'm sure the next one will be better. After that we practiced some musical numbers. The rest of the day was very interesting. There were a lot of interesting lessons:<br>1) We taught Marlon. We went over the Restoration and he understands it very well.<br>2) We taught a metal workshop place. Like 3 of the workers aren't members, but one is an RM and the owners are members. They're pretty good investigators.<br>3) We taught Milton, aka Mufasa. He's got a lot of questions, but he's good. He told us a lot about the scret life of trufi drivers<br>4) We taught Maria, this half french model. She's a surprisingly good investigator.<br>So ya, all sorts of investigators. It was a good day though.</p>

                        <p>Productive day, not as far as numbers, but overall productive. In the morning we just studied all normal and stuff. Then we had weekly planning. I kinda hate weekly planning, but we gotta do it. We actually have investigators though, so that's a good thing. After planning I had a good talk with E' Hansen. We just talked about strengths and weaknesses and stuff. We got pretty deep and it helped a lot. Hansen's a good kid. In the afternoon we had a lesson with Richard and Gladys in which their son bit me. At night we had a lesson with Jesus. He's still doing well. The activities in the church are really helping their family. We taught him the first lesson and it was good. We invited him to be baptized and he's all for it. So like I said, not huge numbers, but productive.</p>

                      <p>Intercambio... Today I went with Elder Gonzales in Villa Graciela 2. It was interesting. Elder Gonzales is a good kid, just a little bit crazy. We taught a little bit in the morning. There's a less active lady that lives by them that we visited. After lunch we went back out to work. We visited some guy whose son is on a mission. We had to give it to him hard, just cause he thought he knew everything, but he didn't. We also saw a monkey, which made my day. We had a good lesson at night with this recent convert/less active family. It was a decent intercambio. Elder Gonzales has changed a lot on his mission. He's still a little rough around the edges, but the mission has helped him. I'm glad to be back with Hansen though.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <p>Quick day. Actually, every day is quick now. The morning was all normal. We taught this guy named Ronald. He's got a lot of good questions, but he doesn't want answers, just more questions. After lunch we taught Eric Rojas, this guy who works at a door/window manufacturer owned by the stake president. He said he prayed and got an answer, so we've got something to work with. It's really good that he works with an RM. After that we went to a stake YW activity. Jesus went and his daughter Ariana danced at the activity. I think it was good to be there with them. After dinner we quickly taught Ivan Porco, and then we taught Waldo. Just every so often he shows potential. I think he wants to change, but his Bolivian culture slows him a little. We'll keep going though, the work is fun.</p>

                    <p>What a stressful day. To start things off no one went to church. Jesus would've come, but he had to go to a meeting that is mandatory under penalty of a fine (happens a lot here). Also, Richard didn't show up to church, so that was a problem. He was supposed to give a testimony in the fireside. We called and looked for him and just nothing. He fell through on us, and every back up as well. We had a suggestion from E' Hernandez, but he wasn't actually ever inactive. We were super stressed, and on top of that all the missionaries were difficult to control. However, through all the problems, the fireside turned out well. The music was good (I was in a quartet of "Abide with me") and it was spiritual. Hno Aparicio, a RC, gave a great testimony, and best of all Jesus and Ariana came and even met President Hansen. So ya, stressful day, but it all came out well in the end.</p>

                    <h3>March 23, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Today wasn't as stressful. The morning was all normal and stuff. Then we went to internet. I had to get a lot of stuff done; I had to get all my college stuff ready. Weird to think of. After that we just went to Hipermaxi. There we bought some sandwiches and potato chips and enjoyed a good ole american lunch. From there we played soccer. It was fun, just to hang out with everyone. I hadn't played in a while. We also took a nap, or tried to at least as people just kept calling. At night we had 2 of the 3 appts fall through, but we did have a good one with Maria. Johnny came with us and it went greagt. She's a good investigator, so it's fun to teach. Johnny helped a lot, and even recited the 1st vision. So not a perfect day, but it was good.</p>
