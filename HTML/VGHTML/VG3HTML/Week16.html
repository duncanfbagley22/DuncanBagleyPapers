            <h1>Week 16 <small>(April 6, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>Happy Birthday Griffin!!!</h3>
            <p><small>Hello again,<br>
    I couldnt think of a great title for the email, so I decided to dedicate this whole title to Griffin. May he enjoy his birthday y que le vaya muy muy bien. Weird he's only 19. He'll get home really young. Good to see (that's a figurative see, I havent seen him for a long time, nor will I until 2016) the little guy growing up. Anywho, this was quite the busy week. Here's what happened...
<br><br>
Monday- Nothing special. I already told you about the activity last week. At night we had a lesson with Milton, and then a solid FHE with the Flia Valle. Hno Valle is the 1st counselor in the stake presidency and they're a great family. I love to see families here that are as strong as any family in the states. There're good members everywhere.
<br><br>
Tuesday- Because we found out we had to open an area, we spent all afternoon on Tuesday looking for a house for the elders. It was like Househunters Cochabamba or something like that. It was rough. We didnt really find much, even though we looked forever. It started raining too, which wasnt that fun. The elders are still looking, hopefully they find something soon. That night we also had the 2 new elders in our house. The first is elder Ruiz from Beni, Bolivia. He has like 4 months and got reassigned to this mission. Good kid. The other is none other than elder Davis, my comp from the offices. Needless to say it'll be good to have him in the zone.
<br><br>
Wednesday- We had the consejo de lideres. It was really good. We talked the entire time about the Book of Mormon. We had read beforehand Elder Holland's talk Safety for the Soul. It just reminded me of the importance of the Book of Mormon. Without it, there really isnt anything we can use to convert people. Plus, you can really see the difference here between people that read and those that dont. If we're really converted, we'll read the Book of Mormon. I think President Jensen told us about how he made a goal to read the Book of Mormon every day of his life, and that until now he is good. I want that same goal for sure. That morning we taught some guy that lived in the states for 7 years and loves english and the culture there. Ya never know, maybe he'll progress.
<br><br>
Thursday- Our only regular work day. Not too much going on though. We have people that are just disappearing here. We cant find a ton of people to teach. We meet a lot of people, but they just dont ever find time to meet with us. We had a lesson with Richard and Gladys though, and that was good.
<br><br>
Friday- We had zone meeting. I like teaching missionaries, and now me and Elder Hansen have been together long enough that we teach well together. We have 26 missionaries in the zone from 10 different countries (USA, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, Argentina, and Brazil). We also have missionaries from 8 different states (Utah, Washington, Idaho, California, Nevada, Arizona, Wyoming, and Missouri). We're quite the diverse zone, but it's a tough task sometimes organizing 24 other missionaries. That day we had to go give a baptismal interview and all that.
<br><br>
Saturday- Conference!!! Basically better than Christmas for a missionary. We watched all the sessions in english. I dont know if it was just because I've got it coming on the future, but I felt like every talk was focused on family and getting married and that stuff. Sometimes I think it'll just be easier to stay in Bolivia than deal with all that stuff. I feel too young. At night we had to go to a member's house to watch it (priesthood session). The member is disabled and in a wheelchair, but he speaks english and served a mission. Awesome guy. I really liked Elder Uchtdorf's talk at night. President told us to go to conference with a question, and there was a part in that talk where I just felt like it was the answer. I really just loved the whole day on saturday.
<br><br>
Sunday- Back for round two. We had less people there, because it was dia del peaton. That's when they outlaw cars and motorcycles for one day to "save the environment". We watched conference in english again, except for the people that spoke spanish. I like it in spanish at that point. Elder Zeballos spoke super fast though, I understood, but I felt bad for the elder next to me that has only 2 months in the mission. The funny moment for me was after Elder Holland's talk. I got a good bunch of notes during all the other talks. During Holland's talk, I didnt want to write anything or even take my eyes off the screen. I turned to Elder Hansen after the talk and I was just like "dude, I didnt even get any notes, I felt bad looking away from the screen". The same thing happened to him. Some talks will need to be studied later. I cant really pick a favorite, but I really really enjoyed every second of conference. 
<br><br>
Monday- We played soccer in the morning, and then we went to the cancha (the gigantic neighborhood/market). I bought a whiteboard. I'm going to use it to teach. Pictures are worth a thousand words, or at least I hope. 
<br><br>
So ya, that's the week. We're still looking hard for investigators. We had one week where everything looked good, but those people have either disappeared or arent progressing for the moment. When looking at the fact that we dont have too much going on, I took solace (right, look at me tossing out big boy words) in what Elder Uchtdorf said. He said something like "sometimes the service that counts the most is the service that only God knows about". We're working really hard and trying to help, so we're doing our part. I love you guys a whole lot and I hope you have a great week. <br>
Elder Bagley

                        <p>Well today wasn't too fun. The morning was normal enough. We had studies and then we had one lesson. We knocked a door and met a lady that we had met before. We persisted and we were able to enter the property and teach a lesson. After that, and lunch is when the day waas boring. We went down to Amancayas to look for a house. We looked for like 3 hours, but we didn't find anything. It was super exhausting and we hardly had an options. We had to also deal with the 2 new missionaries in the zone. Elder Davis and Elder Ruiz. We didn't get a ton done today because we were trying to find a house and just administrative stuff, but I'm sure we did something good.</p>

                        <p>And... it's April. Pretty weird. Today we had a consejo de lideres. Beforehand we taught a lesson to David. He's a guy that lives in the USA for like 7 years, so he speaks english and has an american culture. It's definitely a different culture. A lot easier to deal with David's not a super spiritual guy, but he's cool. After that we went to consejo. It was really good. We talked a lot about the Book of Mormon. Really stressed how important it is, and it really is a great tool we have. The interesting part of the conference was when Pres Hansen got really made cause we're missing so many baptismal records. Like really mad that it scared me. Overall it was a really good conference. We're supposed to study the BoM and I really want to go out and use it more. Not a numbers day, but a day for learning.</p>

                        <p>Woohoo weekly planning!!! I mean darn. It wasn't too bad today. I actually enjoy the companionship inventory part. We usually get deep and find things we need to get better at. We figured that I just need to control a little less. Sometimes we realize things that we never would've any other way. The rest of the day wasn't too spectacular. It was our only real work day, but we couldn't find anyone. We did have a lesson with Richard and Gladys. I just want them to go from like 70% activity to 100%, but sometimes they're difficult. Love them, but they (and mostly I mean Richard) get distracted by the world. They're doing well though. At night we had ward council. This ward really is something special. The bishop went off on how he wants the leaders to go to the temple more. Something that could happen in the states. Decent day, I learn a bunch everyday it seems.</p>

                      <p>Back to more administrative stuff. We had zone meeting today. We took a whole bunch of boxes there. It was a good meeting. We (me and Hansen) retaught what we learned in consejo. It was good I guess. It always takes a lot out of me though. We're up there for like 90min and it's a bit tiring. After the meeting, and lunch, we had a lesson with Concepcion. She's like 80yrs old, but she understands and reads. After that we went to the offices. Nothing too special just the regular office stuff. At night we tried our best to work, but we couldn't really find anyone. On top of that we had to go out to Esmeralda so that Hansen could give a baptismal interview. I just went to our area with Elder Vanegas. Good to get to know him better. He came to the mission, went home for a few months, but he's back now. He's a good kid. Tomorrow's conference, big day.<br><br></p>

                    <p>CONFERENCE!!! Ya, today was conference. We actually got up and taught a lesson to this lady named Marcela. She's decent I guess, not too bad. After that... conference. We had to sprint uphill to the pension and then all the way down to the chapel, but we got there on time. It was great. We watched all the sessions in english, with the whole zone. Conference was focused on the family a lot. We kept bugging Hansen everytime it talked about marriage. At night we watched priesthood at a member in Arocahua's house. He's in a wheelchair, but he's awesome. Served a mission and speaks english. The priesthood sessions answer one of my questions perfectly. I had a strong feeling that it was exactly for me. So ya, great conference. Really sad that's it's already already half over, but it was probably the best day of conference I've had so far.</p>

                    <p>Conference day 2!!! Today was as good as yesterday. We couldn't find anyone in the morning so we just ended up contacting everyone we saw and inviting them to conference. We invited a lot of people. Conference wasn't as crowded for us, with just me, Elder Hansen, and Elder Thronley listening in english. There were a lot of good talks. I think my favorite was Elder Holland's talk. I feel like I say that every conference. Between sessions we ate lunch and watched mormon messages. There's one called "Mountains to climb" that almost makes me cry every time. After conference we went out and tried to work. We taught one kid named Alejandro. Not terrible, but just regular I guess. I'm sad that conference is over. Probably my favorite conference yet. Learned a ton. Modern revelation is the best.</p>

                    <p>Happy birthday to my little brother Griffin. Today was a tiring p-day. At 10 we went and played soccer on the big field. There were a ton of people there, but it was fun. I liked playing with a lot of old buddies, like E' Toomer, E' Harwood, and E' Jacobson. I had a few good goals. I'm good enough to play with anyone here. Those 13 years of soccer pay off. After that we went to the Kancha with Alvaro Alanis. Hansen bought stuff for going home and I bought a whiteboard that I'm going to use to teach. At night we had a lesson with Ligia. We talked about Christ and the atonement. She's cool, her husband is the one that needs a little help. There's also a nice/crazy cholita that lives there and always makes things more interesting. So ya, tiring day, but I liked it.</p>
