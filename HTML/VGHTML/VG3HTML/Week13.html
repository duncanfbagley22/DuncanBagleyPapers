            <h1>Week 13 <small>(March 16, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>Where's Waldo?</h3>
            <p><small>Dear people of the USA,<br>
   This was one heck of a week. One of the better weeks in recent memory. Just full of miracles and great stuff. Usually the first week of the transfer can be a little slow, but me and Elder Hansen got right to work. Usually I like to talk about things day by day, but there was so much stuff this week. I'll just mention the big moments, because there were a lot.
<br><br>
P-day - We had a BBQ with all the people from our old Cobija zone and said bye to Elder Laidlaw. It would be sad, but I'll see him in a few months. It was fun though, cool to see everyone again.
<br><br>
Waldo - This is why the email is titled like it is. I just had to title it like that when we meet someone named Waldo. Wednesday night we were about ready to go home. We had talked to a ton of people that day, but nothing great. We went to this really big house and knocked on the door and met Waldo, who let us in. We showed up at the perfect time. He had just gotten in a fight with his wife and was leaving to go to a hotel. We had a super spiritual lesson and it was just obvious that God led us there. He needs the gospel and I think he realizes that. It'll be an uphill battle to get him progressing, but I know it'll happen. We left the lesson just speechless because it was such an obvious miracle. Just like you hear about all the time from missionaries, it was like that. It changed my outlook on a lot of things
<br><br>
Noche Fogonera - So pres hansen is planning some big fireside for next sunday, and we have to help plan and do a bunch of stuff for it. On saturday we spent 3 hours going around the zone and giving the missionaires materials for advertising it. Long day. Hopefully it goes really well, but we're putting a lot of planning into it. 
<br><br>
Jesus - We met an investigator named Jesus and his daughter Ariana and they are great. They are a reference from our Primary President and 2nd counselor in the bishopric (they're married) and they're just great. We met them on Saturday at an activity and they came to church. We taught them after and like I keep saying, they're great. Jesus's wife left him like 8 years ago and he has raised his children ever since. Super humble, and realizes that he needs the gospel. In the first lesson we had, Ariana asked how she can get baptized, and during the closing prayer he started crying and you could feel the spirit so strong. We have an FHE with them tonight. 
<br><br>
Divisions - We split up with the mission prep class and I went with a girl that has her papers in and a kid working on his papers. We taught a few people and it was cool to be with future missionaries. I learned like they did.
<br><br>
Hna going home - We were really sad this week because an hermana from the zone had to go home for health. She was really cool and a great missionary, so it was sad. Me and Hansen had an idea and as we went around to the whole zone, we brought a new BoM and had everyone write a message and mark a favorite scripture. It turned out really well and we gave it to her. Something small, but it made me feel good. There's the sensative side I picked up in the mission.
<br><br>
So that's the week. We have interviews with Pres this week which should be good. I'm glad to be here in the area. Hopefully everything should keep improving like it has been. Love you all
<br><br>
Elder Bagley
