            <h1>Week 13 <small>(March 16, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>Where's Waldo?</h3>
            <p><small>Dear people of the USA,<br>
   This was one heck of a week. One of the better weeks in recent memory. Just full of miracles and great stuff. Usually the first week of the transfer can be a little slow, but me and Elder Hansen got right to work. Usually I like to talk about things day by day, but there was so much stuff this week. I'll just mention the big moments, because there were a lot.
<br><br>
P-day - We had a BBQ with all the people from our old Cobija zone and said bye to Elder Laidlaw. It would be sad, but I'll see him in a few months. It was fun though, cool to see everyone again.
<br><br>
Waldo - This is why the email is titled like it is. I just had to title it like that when we meet someone named Waldo. Wednesday night we were about ready to go home. We had talked to a ton of people that day, but nothing great. We went to this really big house and knocked on the door and met Waldo, who let us in. We showed up at the perfect time. He had just gotten in a fight with his wife and was leaving to go to a hotel. We had a super spiritual lesson and it was just obvious that God led us there. He needs the gospel and I think he realizes that. It'll be an uphill battle to get him progressing, but I know it'll happen. We left the lesson just speechless because it was such an obvious miracle. Just like you hear about all the time from missionaries, it was like that. It changed my outlook on a lot of things
<br><br>
Noche Fogonera - So pres hansen is planning some big fireside for next sunday, and we have to help plan and do a bunch of stuff for it. On saturday we spent 3 hours going around the zone and giving the missionaires materials for advertising it. Long day. Hopefully it goes really well, but we're putting a lot of planning into it. 
<br><br>
Jesus - We met an investigator named Jesus and his daughter Ariana and they are great. They are a reference from our Primary President and 2nd counselor in the bishopric (they're married) and they're just great. We met them on Saturday at an activity and they came to church. We taught them after and like I keep saying, they're great. Jesus's wife left him like 8 years ago and he has raised his children ever since. Super humble, and realizes that he needs the gospel. In the first lesson we had, Ariana asked how she can get baptized, and during the closing prayer he started crying and you could feel the spirit so strong. We have an FHE with them tonight. 
<br><br>
Divisions - We split up with the mission prep class and I went with a girl that has her papers in and a kid working on his papers. We taught a few people and it was cool to be with future missionaries. I learned like they did.
<br><br>
Hna going home - We were really sad this week because an hermana from the zone had to go home for health. She was really cool and a great missionary, so it was sad. Me and Hansen had an idea and as we went around to the whole zone, we brought a new BoM and had everyone write a message and mark a favorite scripture. It turned out really well and we gave it to her. Something small, but it made me feel good. There's the sensative side I picked up in the mission.
<br><br>
So that's the week. We have interviews with Pres this week which should be good. I'm glad to be here in the area. Hopefully everything should keep improving like it has been. Love you all
<br><br>
Elder Bagley

                        <p>Back to work. It's the first time in a while that I've had nothing to do with transfers. Well we did, but it wasn't planned. The morning and all that was normal. We studied and just regular stuff. After lunch we had a lesson with a girl named Gabriela. We got lost going there, and ended up somehow giving a blessing to an active member. Anyways, we taught Gabriela. She's only like 15, but interested enough. She already went to church once. We had a weird experience in the afternoon. We went to do a service at Richard and Gladys's house, but when we got there we found out that their niece was missing. We went and got pictures to pass out, and as we were about to put one up in Marlon's office, we found out that she'd be found. So, we just taught Marlon instead. At about 6 we found out E' Meadows' companion didn't show up, so we had to pick him up and now we're in a trio. We had correlacion misional as well, which was good. In the morning it seemed like a regular day, but it turned out a little crazy.</p>

                        <p>Wow. One of the most eye-opening days of my mission. In the morning we went and dropped E' Meadows off, then we went to check a house in Esmeralda that the Hnas need to move out of. After that, the work was terrible. We had 23 contacts, and of those 23 probably 3 or 4 were decent. We had a few things fall through, and by night we were beat. As tired as I've ever been in my mission. And then... Hansen suggested we knock a door. Now, words can't do this moment justice. A man opened the door and let us in. We sat down and got to know him. His name is Waldo. He's going through a rought time. So rough that minutes before we got there, he was preparing his stuff because he was going to a hotel that night. We showed up moments before he was going to leave. Just miraculous. He's now 100% interested and we have an appt tomorrow. Words can't do it justice, but I witnessed a miracle. God guided us at the perfect moment, and now we can help Waldo. If there's anything that can build a testimony, it's this.</p>

                        <p>Busy day. In the morning we had weekly planning. First time we've had a solid one without tramites or going to the temple or anything. After weekly planning we just work. Oh, I forgot. After we dropped off Meadows, we went to the Esmeralda Hermanas' house to deal with their angry owner. After that, and planning, we taught Gabriela again. She can progerss, we're just scared cause she's only 15. We waited for Sebastian again, but he didn't show up. We're worried. After all that stuff we went to the center. We taught Waldo in his restaurant. It was good, he'll be an uphill battle, but we'll get him. We also went to the offices. We did all our stuff. We pick up invitationes as well. We ended with ward counsel, also good. Overall, today was good. No complaints.</p>

                      <p>First zone meeting of the new transfer. We still have a lot of cool people in the zone, but we lost a lot of experience. It'll be somewhat of a battle to get everything going well, but it could happen. We had to take care of a bunch of zone stuff. Hansen had everyone bugging him for reimbursements and I had to try to get a bunch of stuff ready for the fireside we have in a week. The rest of the day after that wasn't too interesting. We had a lesson with Felix. He's the kind of guy that wants to talk about deep doctrine, but he doesn't understand the basics. We also went and saw Jhery and Veronica. They're doing well, just that Veronica is a little sick still. Other than that, the other cool moment was contacting a guy from the Cochabamba soccer team. Regular day.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                    <p>One interesting day. A long day. The morning was normal. We had a lesson with a new guy named Teofilo. Nice guy, but he's another one who thinks that every church is ok. I'm really tired of people thinking that. We taught Marlon as well. We went to the city after lunch to pick up some stuff from the secretaries. After that we went to the chapel to meet a reference. Then, we got in a taxi and stayed in that taxi for the next 3 hours. We went through the whole zone, delivering flyers, banners, and stuff for the fireside next Sunday. We went everywhere and it was so tiring. Never want to do that again. We were surprised too cause he only charged us 100bs. Needed to be done, but I'm glad it's over. That was the bulk of the day. We talked to Junior as well. Long day.</p>

                    <p>Today was good. Church was all normal and stuff. There wasn't a ton of interesting stuff, but after church was awesome. Well actually, Jhery got a calling as YM secretary, but other than that nothing cool. The was a reference that Marcia Ferrufino gave us that went to church. His name is Jesus, and his daughter is Ariana. They're awesome. In the first lesson Ariana asked how to be baptized. We had Jesus give the closing prayer, and he started crying and the spirit was way strong. He's a great guy, and we have high hopes for the family. In the afternoon we went on splits with the mission prep class. I went with Sergio Vilca and Carla Chavez. It was good, fun to take around the youth. We had a few good lessons and it was a good experience. At night we had a lesson with Waldo. Not terrible, but it'll be a process to get him. There's hope though. Long tiring week, but it was worth it.</p>

                    <p>What a p-day. In the morning we had a practice/brainstorming for our fireside on sunday. It was good, but sometimes I feel like I'm organizing everything on my own, so it's stressful. It'll turn out ok though. After that we met up with E' Meadows and E' Skousen so that we could look at classes. It's weird to see everything about the future, knowing that it's so close. After that we went to the store, we went to eat, get pictures, and then I got a haircut. Then we went home and took a nap. Greatest decision ever. It felt so good. Just refreshing. Best p-day activity. At night we had all of our activities of the night fall through, so we just ended up having an FHE with the Flia Ferrufino. It was a very relaxing day.</p>
