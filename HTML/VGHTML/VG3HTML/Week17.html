            <h1>Week 17 <small>(April 13, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>Dont Look into the Eyes of the Idol</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
    This was an interesting week. This was Elder Hansen's last full week of work, so we tried to get as much done as possible. He's doing his best to not think of home, but it is kinda hard sometimes. I'm doing my best to not think of home. It'll probably be easier when I get a new companion next week, one that doesnt go home so soon. There're transfers this next week, but we know that I'm staying and Hansen is leaving, so we just wait and see who my next companion is. Anyways, this is what happened this week. 
<br><br>
Monday- At night we had an FHE with Ligia and her old native cholita (that word will make a lot more sense when I can explain it in person). It was good. Ligia is a less active. She's cool, but her husband kinda stinks. We're just going to focus on her for now.
<br><br>
Tuesday- We had our district/zone meeting in the morning. After lunch we taught 2 lessons and went to the office. We taught this old lady named Concepcion. She's like 80, but she's smarter than 95% of all the other people we meet. She actually is reading too. We also taught Waldo. Like I've stated before, we probably wont baptism him or anything, but we have firmly planted the seed. He really likes us and he's slowly progressing. One of those people that I want to stay in contact with after the mission, cause I feel like one day his family will be baptized. 
<br><br>
Wednesday- Just teaching. If the whole day was just teaching, life would be perfect. I would be fine to just teach interested people all day for the rest of my life. The problem is looking for the people. My favorite lesson of the day was with this new lady named Heidi. She lives in the same house as Nora. I always felt like we should talk to her, but she was always busy. Well turns out that her husband is a less active member of like 15 years and she was investigating for a while. She has some kids too, so it's a whole family. That was our only lesson this week, but hopefully we can get something going with them. 
<br><br>
Thursday- We had a great day on Wednesday, but Thursday wasnt quite as great. We taught Richard and Gladys. They were a little down for a bit, but we're trying to get them back up. We have an FHE with them tonight, so we're going to keep them progressing instead of digressing. During the lesson their son Cris almost spit on me. He's super funny, literally makes me laugh everytime we go there. We also had ward counsel (I know that that is spelled wrong, but I'll leave it in the letter just to remember that I forgot english during my mission) that day. Our bishop is still awesome. We also have the greatest EQ president ever. Usually bolivian men are just lazy drunks that beat their wives and chew coca all day. The bishop, WML, and EQ president are actually men I look up to, so way to go Villa Graciela.
<br><br>
Friday- We taught for most the day, but when we got to lunch and we got a call from one of the elders saying that his companion had been depressed for a few days and wasnt talking to him. Well, we ran down there and fixed the problem, talked to them both and hopefully things are going better now. We also had a funny experience. We knocked a door and this 17ish year old girl came out. Elder Hansen presented himself all normal. Then she turned to me. I said my name was Elder Bagley and I asked her name. Well, she just stared at my eyes for like 7 seconds without saying anything and then was startled and was all confused and asked me what I had said. Needless to say, I have great blue eyes that capture the attention of teenage bolivian girls everywhere. Really, girls between like 14 and 17 here just love me. Not really sure how to take it... That night we also taught Jhery and Veronica. Just the coolest people ever. Jhery explained how having the gospel is like crossing a big river with a life jacket. The big rushes of water (trials) will come whether we have a life jacket or not, the gospel just changes whether we float or sink. He's great. We're going to try to get them to the temple here pretty soon.
<br><br>
Saturday- A first for my mission. I was so sick I didnt work. I woke up and couldnt go 20 minutes without going to the bathroom. We stayed home all morning and I slept. In the afternoon, Hansen left me at the pensionistas house with Edmundo her husband, and he went out with a member. I wanted to work, but you could just tell I couldnt. I tried to help though, calling or whatever I could. Between Saturday and Friday, I went to the bathroom 18 times, a new record. I'm feeling better now. Hansen had a great day though, so the work pressed on.
<br><br>
Sunday- Just a regular day. Good to be back at normal church for the first time in 3 weeks.
<br><br>
So that's the week. I dont really know where I'll be this weekend, but by next monday I should know who my next comp is and all that. Love you all. God Speed<br>
Elder Bagley
<br><br>
p.s the title refers to my eyes and their effect on teenage girls. I know really only the immediate family will understand though. I feel like my eyes just turn them to stone. Thanks for giving me blue eyes mom and dad

                        <p>Busy day. In the morning we had district meeting. It was good. We have probably the best DL in the world in Elder Meadows, so it's always good. We also had a little zone class. We talked a little about conference and all that. It's weird, everytime I think the zone is good, we have no numbers, but whenever I worry about the zone, the numbers come. Weird. After zone meeting and lunch we had a lesson. We taught Concepcion. She's like 80 but she understands. Best old lady I've ever taught. We also went to the offices. Vega showed me a letter the Sucre ZLs wrote the registros secretary that beat on him for doing his job right or something. Biggest fiasco I've ever seen with baptismal records. To end the day we taught Waldo. He's not amazing, but he's growing. I'm convinced that we found him through the will of God, so he'll progress one day.</p>

                        <p>Solid day today. We were suppposed to have 2 lessons in the morning, but they both fell through. We did however go do tramites, so now me and Hansen are both 100% legal. After that, we just went home and studied. We had a good number of lessons in the afternoon. Oh, I forgot, we visited Kevin in the morning. He's not doing too great, so we wanna keep an eye on him. After lunch, we tried to visit Marlon, but he was either working or Jhanet was in bad shape because her tooth hurt. We waited for a while, but we did end up teaching him. We also found a new investigator. Where Nora lives, there's a family that I always felt like we should visit. Turns out the husband is a member and the wife investigated for a while. We taught her, Heidi, and it went pretty well. At night we taught Junior. From the first day until now, he's progressed well. I wouldn't call him active yet, but he's doing well. So like I said, solid day. I had a good feeling afterwards, so I know I did what I needed to today.</p>

                        <p>Today wasn't quite as good as yesterday, but it wasn't awful. In the morning we just studied and then we had weekly planning. Even though Hansen is a goofy kid and 100% the opposite of me, I've really enjoyed him as a companion. I'm gonna miss him when he's gone. After studies and lunch we went out and worked. We didn't have much success. We had one guy drop us, 2 appts fall through, and stuff like that. We did meet a JW that was nice though. We had one lesson with Richard and Gladis. They're doing ok, they just need to pick it up a bit. They realize it though. It was a good lesson. At night we had consejo de barrio. Not too many people showed up. I guess the bishop announced it late on Whatsapp, the phone app everyone (besides us) uses to communicate. It was a good consejo though. If every bishop was like our bishop, the mission would be a lot more successful. So that's the day (I never know how to end a journal entry).</p>

                      <p>Really interesting day. Up until lunch it was pretty normal. We had a lesson with Marlon in the morning. It was good, they know that Jhanet's baby is a girl now, so it makes things a little bit more real. Hopefully it pushes them a little. During lunch we got a call from Elder Calderon saying that he was having problems with Elder Sharp. Big enough problems that me and Hansen flew out to Huayani to fix it. Hansen talked to Sharp and I talked to Calderon. Sharp was basically frustrated with himself, to a level where he didn't wanna talk to anyone or work. Hansen helped him though, so it's all good. We worked in the afternoon, but I've been sick. I went to the bathroom 10 times today. Hopefully I get better. At night we had a great lesson with Jhery and Veronica. They're still great. Jhery gave an example of trials in life that was good enough to be in General Conference. They are a great example of why we preach the gospel, to find families like that.</p>

                    <p>Well... not much happened for me today. I was sick all day. All morning I just slept. We went to lunch, where I just ate the soup and that was it. After lunch we met up with Jhony. Hansen went with Jhony and they left me with Edmundo at the pension. Then, I slept again. I just hung out there all day, and Hansen worked with Jhony. I was super bored all day, but it sounds like Hansen had a really good day. So ya that's the day for me. At least I feel a little bit better.</p>

                    <p>Just a regular day, well regular Sunday. We studied and stuff in the morning. I was still feeling a little sick, but better than yesterday. We went to church and saw none other than the Grigor family. The ex Elder Grigor and his family were back visiting. Really nice people. We spent the whole second hour talking to them and all that. Weird to see someone like Grigor not a missionary anymore. After church and lunch we only had one lesson. We were able to teach Hna Chocala. Both of her daughters are members, but she isn't. She's starting to go to church though. We quickly shared a video and taught a bit. Maybe she'll progress, who knows. Anyways, we're entering into Hansen's last week. It'll be a battle to not think of home.</p>

                    <h3>April 13, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Hansen's last p-day. Boy was it fun. We got up and then we went to buy stuff for the activity. We planned on playing minute-to-win-it (not sure if that should be with dashes or not) games and eating pizza. We had to look up some games on the internet, but we got it all done and ready to go by 10:30. People showed up late and all that, but we did have the activity. It's kinda hard to keep control of 24 other missionaries, so it was a bit frustrating. It turned out well though. After the activity we did email, I sat between Hansen and Meadows and both of their families are very trunki. After that we got haircuts, and finally we had an FHE with the Flia Garcia. It was good. We watched some Mormon Messages and had dinner. After going downhill for a bit, their back progressing again. Anyways, good day. Good way to start this interesting week.</p>
