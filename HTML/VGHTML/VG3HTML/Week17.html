            <h1>Week 17 <small>(April 13, 2015)</small></h1>
            <h3>Dont Look into the Eyes of the Idol</h3>
            <p><small>Dear Family,<br>
    This was an interesting week. This was Elder Hansen's last full week of work, so we tried to get as much done as possible. He's doing his best to not think of home, but it is kinda hard sometimes. I'm doing my best to not think of home. It'll probably be easier when I get a new companion next week, one that doesnt go home so soon. There're transfers this next week, but we know that I'm staying and Hansen is leaving, so we just wait and see who my next companion is. Anyways, this is what happened this week. 
<br><br>
Monday- At night we had an FHE with Ligia and her old native cholita (that word will make a lot more sense when I can explain it in person). It was good. Ligia is a less active. She's cool, but her husband kinda stinks. We're just going to focus on her for now.
<br><br>
Tuesday- We had our district/zone meeting in the morning. After lunch we taught 2 lessons and went to the office. We taught this old lady named Concepcion. She's like 80, but she's smarter than 95% of all the other people we meet. She actually is reading too. We also taught Waldo. Like I've stated before, we probably wont baptism him or anything, but we have firmly planted the seed. He really likes us and he's slowly progressing. One of those people that I want to stay in contact with after the mission, cause I feel like one day his family will be baptized. 
<br><br>
Wednesday- Just teaching. If the whole day was just teaching, life would be perfect. I would be fine to just teach interested people all day for the rest of my life. The problem is looking for the people. My favorite lesson of the day was with this new lady named Heidi. She lives in the same house as Nora. I always felt like we should talk to her, but she was always busy. Well turns out that her husband is a less active member of like 15 years and she was investigating for a while. She has some kids too, so it's a whole family. That was our only lesson this week, but hopefully we can get something going with them. 
<br><br>
Thursday- We had a great day on Wednesday, but Thursday wasnt quite as great. We taught Richard and Gladys. They were a little down for a bit, but we're trying to get them back up. We have an FHE with them tonight, so we're going to keep them progressing instead of digressing. During the lesson their son Cris almost spit on me. He's super funny, literally makes me laugh everytime we go there. We also had ward counsel (I know that that is spelled wrong, but I'll leave it in the letter just to remember that I forgot english during my mission) that day. Our bishop is still awesome. We also have the greatest EQ president ever. Usually bolivian men are just lazy drunks that beat their wives and chew coca all day. The bishop, WML, and EQ president are actually men I look up to, so way to go Villa Graciela.
<br><br>
Friday- We taught for most the day, but when we got to lunch and we got a call from one of the elders saying that his companion had been depressed for a few days and wasnt talking to him. Well, we ran down there and fixed the problem, talked to them both and hopefully things are going better now. We also had a funny experience. We knocked a door and this 17ish year old girl came out. Elder Hansen presented himself all normal. Then she turned to me. I said my name was Elder Bagley and I asked her name. Well, she just stared at my eyes for like 7 seconds without saying anything and then was startled and was all confused and asked me what I had said. Needless to say, I have great blue eyes that capture the attention of teenage bolivian girls everywhere. Really, girls between like 14 and 17 here just love me. Not really sure how to take it... That night we also taught Jhery and Veronica. Just the coolest people ever. Jhery explained how having the gospel is like crossing a big river with a life jacket. The big rushes of water (trials) will come whether we have a life jacket or not, the gospel just changes whether we float or sink. He's great. We're going to try to get them to the temple here pretty soon.
<br><br>
Saturday- A first for my mission. I was so sick I didnt work. I woke up and couldnt go 20 minutes without going to the bathroom. We stayed home all morning and I slept. In the afternoon, Hansen left me at the pensionistas house with Edmundo her husband, and he went out with a member. I wanted to work, but you could just tell I couldnt. I tried to help though, calling or whatever I could. Between Saturday and Friday, I went to the bathroom 18 times, a new record. I'm feeling better now. Hansen had a great day though, so the work pressed on.
<br><br>
Sunday- Just a regular day. Good to be back at normal church for the first time in 3 weeks.
<br><br>
So that's the week. I dont really know where I'll be this weekend, but by next monday I should know who my next comp is and all that. Love you all. God Speed<br>
Elder Bagley
<br><br>
p.s the title refers to my eyes and their effect on teenage girls. I know really only the immediate family will understand though. I feel like my eyes just turn them to stone. Thanks for giving me blue eyes mom and dad
