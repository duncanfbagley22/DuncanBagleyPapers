Dear President Hansen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm really glad that you enjoyed the fireside. It went very well I think. I was really disappointed to not have a reactivated member there to speak, but I enjoyed Hno Aparicio's testimony a lot. He's the kind of convert the church needs. The music went really well as well. I'm sure you could tell that we were very stressed, but I'm glad it worked out in the end. We had a good number of people in our ward there, so hopefully it inspired them. I was also very happy to see Jesus there. He's doing great so far as an investigator. He knows a lot of members and really wants the best for his family. He's dropped everything in his life to help his children, as his wife left him 8 years ago. He said that he's ready to drop everything to follow God as well, something that doesnt happen a lot here. I really hope he continues well, he needs the church and the church needs him. We had a cool experience this week that shows me the power of the members in this work. Through contacting we met a lady named Lourdes last sunday I think. We got an appt with her, but she wasnt there, but her husband was and let us in. We came into a workshop with like 4 people working there. Come to find out, the owner of the shop is Pdte Velasco and his family. 1 of the workers is an RM and the other 3 are now investigators. They all know how to pray very well and they've been to general conference before. They're very receptive and we're hoping that the husband and the woman we met can progress. Goes to show that the influence of members is huge. As far as the zone, we're a little worried. The numbers are going down and we cant seem to grab the attention of the zone. A great example is that this week we did intercambios and I went with Elder Gonzales. He worked very well with me, and Elder Torres with Elder Hansen, but when they're not with us, we know that they dont work super well. Any advice on how to leave a lasting impact on the zone? That's all, I'm really glad to be working here with Elder Hansen, and even though we have little time left, we're working our hardest. Thanks.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder Bagley

p.s Sorry, another question on what to do. This week Hno Aparicio and another hermano in our ward came an gave us a reference. When we found out where they lived and told them that they needed to talk to the other elders because it was their area they said "we know, but we really need good committed missionaries to teach the family, that's why we came to you two". Do we teach them or what do we do, because I know that the other elders dont really get along with Hno Aparicio and he doesnt want to give them the reference?

Talk to the other elders and explain that Hno. Aparicio specifically requested that you, instead of them, teach his reference. It will be awkward, but help them learn the importance of having the trust of the members. I think it's okay that you teach this reference, but not "behind the backs" of the other missionaries, but rather by letting them know why you are doing it.
<br>
<br>
P.S. Try to include the other missionaries when teaching this reference, by doing special splits so that one of them and one of you can go teach Hno. Aparicio's reference. That way perhaps they won't feel so bad or like you are "poaching" in their area.
